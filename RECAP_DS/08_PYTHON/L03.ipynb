    "    - For Mac, press `command` and the space bar at the same time. Type in `terminal` and press `enter`. A separate Terminal window will pop up.\n",
    "2. Now that you are in your Command Prompt/Terminal, run the following command:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd desktop\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Next, move your command prompt/terminal's location to the new `python_course` you just created by running the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd python_course\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. Create a _new_ directory within the `python_course` directory. This new folder is the project you will be working in for this lesson. Run the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    mkdir lesson_three\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Open up a new window in VSCode.\n",
    "6. The first thing you should see a Welcome page. You can close this window.\n",
    "7. Now, its time to open the `lesson_three` directory. Click on the \"Explorer\" button on the left-hand side of the VSCode window.\n",
    "8. You will now see a button that says `Open Folder`, as shown below. Click this button.\n",
    "9. A new window will open that will allow you to search for files and folders. Locate the `python_course` folder you just created on your Desktop. Click on that folder and then locate the `lesson_three` folder. Select the `lesson_three` directory and click the `Open` button.\n",
    "10. Create a new file named `main.py` by one of the following three ways:\n",
    "    - To the right of __LESSON_THREE_ in the EXPLORER is a button that looks like a piece of paper with a plus symbol in its top-left corner. If you hover your mouse over this button for a moment, a popup will appear indicating that this button will create a new file.\n",
    "    - Choose `File > New File` from the app's menu.\n",
    "    - Press `Control + N` in Windows or `Command + N` on a Mac (the plus means \"and at the same time\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the `main.py` file is created, you are ready to go! As you work through this lesson, add the code examples into your project so you can see the output yourself. Remember, to see the output within the VSCode terminal, right-click within your file and choose \"Run Python File in Terminal\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of this new project is for you to practice your new skills. It is highly recommended that you add the code from this lesson into your `lesson_three` project as you learn it. As you are going through this lesson and adding code to your project, you may find it helpful to include `comments` with a brief sentence explaining what is going on in the code. That way, you will have an easy reference to the topics explained in this lesson. Happy coding!\n"

This is where the use of the *index*, or position, of an item in a list is important. Python considers the first item in a list to be at position `0` and not position `1` (unlike R). These positions are integers. This is illustrated below:\n",

    "\n",
    "Looping, or iterating, is an important concept to understand. Undoubtedly, you will need to iterate over lists throughout your programming career. So, below you will find another example to help you gain a solid understanding of iteration using a `for` loop.\n",

    "# 1. a list of numbers from 1-5\n",
    "all_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",

    "# 2. an empty list that will store even numbers\n",
    "even_numbers = []\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. loop through `all_numbers` and add the even\n",
    "# numbers to the `even_numbers` list\n",
    "for the_number in all_numbers:\n",
    "    # 4. if the number is even, add to `even_numbers`\n",
    "    if the_number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        even_numbers.append(the_number)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Ignoring the odd number: \", the_number)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. print out `even_numbers`\n",
    "print(even_numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**OUTPUT**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Ignoring the odd number: 1\n",
    "Ignoring the odd number: 3\n",
    "Ignoring the odd number: 5\n",
    "[2, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, there are numbered comments that will be discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The list `all_numbers` is created first, and it contains numbers from 1 through 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An empty list variable named `even_numbers` is created. This list will, eventually, contain the list of even numbers of the `all_numbers` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `for` loop iterates over each number in the `all_numbers` list variable. The variable `the_number` will contain the value of each number of the list as it loops through. __A colon is required at the end of this line!__\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The four lines of code beneath this comment have the same indentation, so they are considered as one block of code that gets executed for each item in the list. First, it tests whether the current number of the list is even (`the_number % 2 == 0`), and if it is, it adds it to the `even_numbers` list. Otherwise, it prints out a message with the odd number.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once the `for` loop has finished iterating over the list of `all_numbers`, the `even_numbers` list should now contain the even numbers, and it is printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both examples above, the `country` and `the_number` variables in the `for` loops are named as desired. They could have been named any way you'd like, but you should name them such that they make sense. Since the variable name for the list is plural (e.g. \"countries\"), the temporary variable that holds the current value while looping should be singular (e.g. \"country\"), since it represents an individual item.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! Next, you'll see another way you can iterate over a list.\n",

    "The `while` loop is another mechanism for iterating over the items of a list; it is similar to a `for` loop, but there is a noteworthy difference.\n",

The `while` loop is then set to continue running _while_ the value of `a_number` is less than or equal to `5`. The code block within the loop prints out the number and then increments it by 1 (`a_number += 1`). Remember, the `+=` operator is shorthand &mdash; it could have been written as `a_number = a_number + 1`. Because you can overwrite variables, you will keep changing the value of `a_number` until that value gets to be `5`, at which point the `while` loop will stop because the condition of `a_number` less than 5 has no longer been met.\n",

What if the line of code that increments `current_position` was excluded? The condition to terminate the `while` loop would never be met, so the loop would continue on forever. NOT GOOD! Always ensure that your test condition can be satisfied without locking up the system with a never-ending loop.\n",

    "For your Lesson 3 Practice Hands-On, you will be working with your new knowledge of lists and loops. For this project, you will be creating a new directory, so please follow the below setup instructions. This Hands-On will **not** be graded, but we encourage you to complete it. The best way to become a great programmer is to practice! Once you have submitted your project, you will be able to access the solution on the next page.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, open up your command prompt/terminal\n",
    "2. Within your command prompt/terminal, run the following command:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd desktop\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Next, run the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd python_course\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. Run the following to create a new directory for this project:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    mkdir lesson_three_handson\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Open up a new window in VSCode.\n",
    "6. Click on the \"Explorer\" button on the left-hand side of the VSCode window.\n",
    "7. Click the `Open Folder` button.\n",
    "8. Select the `lesson_three_handson` directory within the `python_course` folder on your Desktop. Click the `Open` button.\n",
    "10. Create a new file named `main.py` by one of the following three ways:\n",
    "    - To the right of __LESSON_THREE_HANDSON__ in the EXPLORER is a button that looks like a piece of paper with a plus symbol in its top-left corner. If you hover your mouse over this button for a moment, a popup will appear indicating that this button will create a new file.\n",
    "    - Choose `File > New File` from the app's menu.\n",
    "    - Press `Control + N` in Windows or `Command + N` on a Mac (the plus means \"and at the same time\").\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "## Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a list of the following first names: `Kurt`, `David`, `Katherine`.\n",
    "2. The variable name for the above list should be `list_of_names`.\n",
    "3. Use a `for` loop to loop through each name in the list and print the following question: `Where is _____ today?`\n",
    "    - Each name should replace the blank within the question.\n",
    "4. The output should look like the following:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    Where is Kurt today?\n",
    "    Where is David today?\n",
    "    Where is Katherine today?\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create three separate lists with the following variable names: `my_favorite_cars`, `my_favorite_flowers`, `my_favorite_animals`\n",
    "    - `my_favorite_cars` should include 3 different cars\n",
    "    - `my_favorite_flowers` should include 4 different flowers\n",
    "    - `my_favorite_animals` should include 5 different animals\n",
    "2. Concatenate the above three lists into a single list named `my_favorite_things`.\n",
    "3. Use a `for` loop to iterate over each element of the `my_favorite_things` combined list. Print out each item with an even length.\n",
    "    - The output should show only items in the `my_favorite_things` list that have an even number of letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Part 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, add to your program new code that does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a list named `number_range` that includes the numbers 1 - 20\n",
    "2. Loop through the list\n",
    "3. For every number that is divisible by 3 _and_ 5, print `ZipZap`\n",
    "4. For every number that is divisible by 3, print `Zip`\n",
    "5. For every number that is divisible by 5, print `Zap`\n",
    "6. If the number is not divisible by any of the three, then just print the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your output should look like the following:\n",
