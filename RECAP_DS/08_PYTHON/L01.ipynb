    "# What is Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming** is the ability to come up with a solution to a problem and then write that solution down in a way the computer can understand. This is done through a *programming language*, which gives programmers a tool to specify step-by-step instructions on what to do and how to do it. Programming languages empower programmers to speak to the computer using words rather than the 0's and 1's, or binary, that computers understand. The programming language that programmers use is translated into the binary that a computer understands using a program known as a *compiler*. **Compilers** are the bridge between how you solve your problem using a programming language and what the computer accepts as instructions. This module will empower you as a programmer to build applications that solve a variety of problems.\n",

Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms._\" - **[Python Docs](https://www.python.org/doc/)**\n",

    "Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in 1991! How many of you were alive then? It has changed a lot since then. Lucky for you, you will be using Python 3, the most recent version.  Python 3 was released in 2008, and there have been several smaller updates since then. The final version of Python 2, which was 2.7, came out in mid-2010 and will, most likely, see no major new releases.\n",

About halfway down the page you should see a section for `Python Path` OR you can type `python path` in the search bar located above `User` and `Workspace` to fast track you to where you need to be.

    "3. Now your command prompt/terminal's specified location is the desktop. Run the following to create a new, empty folder named `python_course` on your desktop:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    mkdir python_course\n",

    "    - The `mkdir` keyword stands for `make directory`. A `directory` is essentially a folder on your computer but in programming is referred to as a `directory`.\n",
    "    - This folder, `python_course`, is where all projects for this course will live, including all projects you create within the lessons and the hands-on projects.\n",

    "    ```text\n",
    "    cd python_course\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "12. After creating a new file from one of the three above options, you will be able to enter a name for the new file. This file should be named `main.py`.\n",

    "    - You may need to right click on the new file and choose `Rename` from the pop-up menu to name the file.\n",
    "13. Once you've created the file and it's open in the editor, take a look at the bottom-right of VS Code. You should see the word \"Python\". This means that VS Code recognizes that this file is to be used for Python code, as shown below:\n",

    "1. Within the `main.py` file, create three variables that are set to the following questions:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    What is your name?\n",
    "    How old are you?\n",
    "    How many months is that?\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    > Hint! Make sure to write these as strings.\n",
    "2. Next, create three more variables that are set to the following answers to the above questions:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    My name is \"Billy\".\n",
    "    30\n",
    "    360\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Use the print function to print each of the variables. The output should looks like below:\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    What is your name?\n",
    "    My name is \"Billy\".\n",
    "    How old are you?\n",
    "    30\n",
    "    How many months is that?\n",
    "    360\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Make sure `Billy` is surrounded by quotes in the output\n",
    "4. Next, comment out the appropriate variables and print functions so the output now looks like below:\n",
    "     ```text\n",
    "    What is your name?\n",
    "    My name is \"Billy\".\n",
    "    How old are you?\n",
    "    30\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Finally, create three new variables: `my_string`, `my_integer`, and `my_float`. \n",
    "    - Each variable should be set to the appropriate data type based on the name of the variable name. The actual values you use is not important. What is important is that you match up the right type of data with the right variable. \n",
