    "Welcome to the Final Project for Programming Foundations in Python! Great job making it this far! This Final Project will be different from the Hands-On projects you have previously seen in a couple of different ways. For the Final Project, you will be putting together the numerous topics you have learned into one large project. It is designed to mimic real problems which you may face in your career, so it may be a challenge for you and will also take several hours. Take this project step-by-step and be aware that the project description below is written to be a bit less specific than previous Hands-Ons. The Final Project is supposed to challenge you to do some problem solving to figure out how to accomplish a task. You can always review past lessons or use a Google search if needed. Good luck!\n",

This project already includes the `main.py` file. Once this project is downloaded, unzipped, and opened in VSCode, you will be ready to go! \n",

    "3. Add the dictionary to the `tasks` list. \n",
