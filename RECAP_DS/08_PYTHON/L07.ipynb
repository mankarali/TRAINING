Python also has a _standard library_, that has an extensive range of built-in modules that provide access to system functionality. In this lesson, you will learn about Python's standard library and a few of the more widely-used Python packages that are built and shared by third-party developers.\n",

    "The creation of this new project is for you to practice your new skills. It is highly recommended that you add the code from this lesson into your `lesson_seven` project as you learn it. As you are going through this lesson and adding code to your project, you may find it helpful to include `comments` with a brief sentence explaining what is going on in the code. That way, you will have an easy reference to the topics explained in this lesson. Happy coding!\n"

Some of these modules provide interfaces that are specific to particular operating systems, such as access to a specific piece of hardware.\n",

    "# Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "A `module` is groups of related code, including classes and functions, that allows you to logically organize your Python code. Creating modules of re-usable code is the goal. As you grow into developing Python programs, you'll eventually find yourself writing the same or similar functions and classes in several of them. Putting that code in modules and importing them into your new program will save you time and money.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward approach to creating a module is placing the related code into a single Python file, with the extension \".py\" as you've seen throughout this course. In it, you would place your variables, classes, and functions. Once you've created a module, you can reuse the code by importing it into your new code. This mechanism, thus, allows you to import code from other developers to use in your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, go ahead and create two files in the same directory (folder). Name one of them `icecream.py` and the other `icecream_cone.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following code snippet to the `icecream.py` file.\n",

    "- The function `scoop_icecream` is defined with two parameters `size` and `toppings`. The asterisk `*` in front of the `toppings` parameter indicates that you can pass in one or more values for toppings when calling the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function `scoop_icecream`, when called, prints to the console a message that includes the passed values of `size` and `toppings`. Due to the `*` you see preceding the `toppings` parameter, you can treat `toppings` like a collection, which is why you see the `for` loops to print the toppings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the `icecream_cone.py` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `import icecream` - This line pulls in (imports) the code from the other file `icecream.py`, giving you access to the `scoop_icecream` function defined in it. The keyword `import` is followed by the name of the file __without__ the `py` extension. You never add the `py` extension when you import files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The next two lines call the function `scoop_icecream` that was imported, passing in different sets of toppings (remember the *). As you can see, the function name is prefixed with `icecream.`, which is the name of the module file and a dot. So, when calling an imported function, you see that you specify the module file name, followed by a dot `.`, then the function name. You will see variations to this shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## import\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword `import` tells Python to open the file and copy all the function from it into the current program. You do not see this occurring, though; Python does all of this behind the scenes as the program runs. Once imported, any function that is in the targeted file will be available in your current file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import an entire module, making every function and class it contains available to your program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "## Using Functions from Imported Module\n",
    "\n",
    "To call a function from an imported module, enter the name of the module you imported, followed by the name of the function separated by a dot(`.`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the syntax used to invoke a function from an imported module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "module_name.function_name()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Importing Specific Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "If a module is large, but you only need one function, there's no point plugging up memory with unnecessary code; you can import a single function. Below is the general syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from module_name import function_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, you can see the keywords `from` and `import` are used. When importing a specific function, you use the `from` keyword to specify the module from which it will be imported. You then use the `import` keyword to specify the specific function you wish to import.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also import as many functions as you would like from a module by separating each function name with a comma like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from module_name import function_1, function_2, function_3\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from icecream import scoop_icecream\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you import a function in this fashion, you no longer need to use the dot notation when calling the function. Instead of doing _module.function()_, you can simply do _function()_. In the example below, the `scoop_icecream()` function is imported specifically, and then called:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from icecream import scoop_icecream\n",
    "\n",
    "scoop_icecream('small', 'sprinkles', 'chocolate', 'cherries')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## as\n",
    "\n",
    "When you import a module, what if there's a function that is defined that has the same name as a function in the new file, or in another module you've already imported? Fortunately, Python provides a mechanism for giving an imported function an alias: `as`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from icecream import scoop_icecream as scoop\n",
    "\n",
    "scoop('small', 'sprinkles', 'chocolate', 'cherries')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `import` statement above renames the function `scoop_icecream()` to `scoop()` in this specific file. Anytime you want to call `scoop_icecream()`, you can now call `scoop()` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from module_name import function_name as alias\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only can functions be given an alias, but modules can be given an alias as well. Giving a module a short alias like `i` for `icecream` allows you to call the module's functions more quickly. Calling `i.scoop_icecream()` is more concise than calling `icecream.scoop_icecream()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import icecream as i\n",
    "\n",
    "i.scoop_icecream('small', 'sprinkles', 'chocolate', 'cherries')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When giving the module an alias, remember that all the function names will retain their original names. Calling `i.scoop_icecream()` is not only more concise than writing `icecream.scoop_icecream()`, but also directs your attention from the module name and allows you to focus on the more descriptive names of the functions. The function names, which tell you what each function does, are more important to the readability of your code than using full module names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax for assigning an alias to a module is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import module_name as alias\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Importing All Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can tell Python to import every function from a module by using the asterisk `*` operator. Of course, anytime you import a large amount of functionality, be sure to check if there are any conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from icecream import *\n",
    "\n",
    "scoop_icecream('small', 'sprinkles', 'chocolate', 'cherries')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, all functions are imported using the `*` (although there's currently only one function in the file). This allows for the use of the function name without having to include the module name and dot notation for all of the imported functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "## Importing Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "What you learned about importing a specific, multiple, or all functions also applies to classes. The general syntax for importing a class is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from module_name import class_name[, more_class_names]|*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above general notation includes some syntax you've not yet seen. The square brackets `[]` indicate something is optional. Above, this mean that you can import a class name and optionally more class names separated by a comma. The pipe symbol `|` is used to separate options from which you choose one. Above, the option is to either choose one or more class names or to use the asterisk `*` to import all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, when importing a specific class, you can set an alias just like you can with a function. You can even import functions and classes, both with aliases, in a simple import statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from module_name import function_name as function_alias, class_name as class_alias\n",
    "```"
