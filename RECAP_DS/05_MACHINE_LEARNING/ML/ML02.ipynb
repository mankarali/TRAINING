    "# Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "*Clustering* is a type of unsupervised learning in which similar data are grouped together. This means the clustering algorithm does not have a label for each piece of data but finds similarities within the data itself. Here's a scenario where this would be useful: pretend the company Netflix released the first season of a new comedy show. Over the next week or so, Netflix continues to gather information about who's watched it and rated the show highly. Every user on their platform has an account containing age, gender, city of residence, and so on. Netflix could then run a clustering analysis algorithm on the gathered data that would produce a cluster of the different demographics that like their show. Perhaps the show is popular amongst male Texans between ages 18-35 or female Canadians between ages 45-65. This would be invaluable information for the company's marketing department, as they can advertise on specific platforms rather than in a generic setting.\n",

    "# k-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "_k_-means clustering is a popular algorithm used for cluster analysis via unsupervised machine learning. Once the k-means algorithm is given the list of data and the number of expected clusters, it is capable of calculating how similar each piece of data is to each cluster and assigning to the cluster that best classifies the data. However, the _k_-means algorithm doesn't do this in one step. It takes an iterative approach to clustering the data points. Initially, the _k_ number of points are chosen at random. As the nearest points are clustered to one of the _k_ points, the mean, or location, to the point is recalculated. The cycle is then repeated until all data clusters are added to a cluster. The animated GIF below illustrates how with each iteration of applying the _k_-means algorithm, the _k_ points are refined. Notice that the variation is minimal as the data points converge.\n",

    "If you look at this image, the green point is the unknown, or the data point you are trying to predict.  You are trying to gauge whether the green circle should fall with the blue squares, or with the red triangles.  If you looked at a *k* of 3 (surrounded by the solid black line) then you may assume that the green circle should really be classified as a red triangle.  But if you were to expand to a *k* of 6 (surrounded by the dotted black line) then you may assume that instead, the green circle should be classified as a blue triangle.  This demonstrates that the number of neighbors is important! Luckily, functions in Python will not only help you run KNN, but also help you determine the optimal *k* for any given dataset. \n",
