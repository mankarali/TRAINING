    "*Simple linear regression* is a method used to fit a line to data when you only have two variables.  Regression allows you to write an equation that models the relationship between the independent variable, x, and the dependent variable, y. You can think of x as a predictor, and y as the outcome you are trying to predict. When the model is created, it allows you to predict the value of y for any given value of x. \n",

    "## Linear Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear equation is the technical term for any equation that describes a line. Two important characteristics of a line are its *slope* and its *y-intercept*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### y-Intercept\n",
    "\n",
    "The *y-intercept* is the value at which the line crosses the y-axis. Stated differently, the y-intercept is the value of y that corresponds to x = 0. Given the equation of a line, you can find the y-intercept by plugging in a zero for the x. You may remember having done this during algebra class in high school. Remember that old standby equation, ```y = mx + b```? Well, the ```b``` part of it is the y-intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```y = 12x + 7```\n",
    "\n",
    "and you set the value of x to 0, then the equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```y = 12(0) + 7```.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Anything times zero is zero, so ```y = 7```.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slope\n",
    "\n",
    "The *slope* of a line, ```m```, is a measure of how steep the line is. It shows how much influence x has on y. If the slope is positive, then the value of y increases as the value of x increases. If the slope is negative, the value of y decreases as x increases. This is similar to correlations. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the slope is expressed as a fraction, the numerator (the number on top) indicates the vertical change when moving from a single point on the line to another point on the line. The denominator (the number on the bottom) indicates the horizontal change. Try an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a point on the graph below at (0,2) - which is expressed as being at (x,y).  So it is 0 on the x-axis, and 2 on the y-axis. If you have the linear equation ```y = (3/5)x + 2```, where would the next point fall?\n",
    "\n",
    "![A graph showing the x and y axes. There is a point plotted at open parentheses zero comma two close parentheses. A line with an upward slope passes through the point.](Media/L01-01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the slope is 3/5, then if you want to move from the point (0, 2) to another point on the graph, you can go up 3 (the numerator of the slope, up is positive) and to the right 5 (the denominator of the slope, right is positive) to arrive at the point (5, 5), which will also be on the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A graph showing the x and y axes. There is a point plotted at open parentheses zero comma two close parentheses and a point at open parentheses five comma five close parentheses. A line with an upward slope of three fifths passes through the two points and continues in both directions.](Media/L01-02.png)\n",

    "## Linear Equations in Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression, you probably will see different notation than in algebra. The y-intercept is represented with the symbol b<sub>0</sub> and the slope with the symbol b<sub>1</sub>. You can remember the difference between these two by thinking that your y-intercept is the y value when x is zero - so the symbol has a zero in it ( b<sub>0</sub>). \n",

    "> y = b<sub>1</sub>x + b<sub>0</sub>\n",

The coefficient represents the magnitude of change that will take place in y based on the x variable. Regardless of what tool is used to create the regression equation, the output will give values for b<sub>0</sub> and b<sub>1</sub>. In this case, the y-intercept, b<sub>0</sub>, = −18.274.

    "When the regression equation was created, the head length was the predictor variable (x), and the body length was the response (y). So, in terms of the regression equation, you have a slope of b<sub>1</sub> = 7.660. Or, with every 1 cm increase in the length of the head, the body is expected to increase by about 7.66 cm. This is the practical interpretation for any simple linear regression equation - that is, a one unit change in the horizontal axis variable predicts a b<sub>1</sub> unit change in the vertical axis variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the y-Intercept\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the interpretation of b<sub>0</sub>, the y-intercept? For this, you often need to be a bit careful. For example, with the crocodile data, the y-intercept of the regression equation is b<sub>0</sub> = −18.274. This means that if the head length gets down to 0 cm, the predicted body length is ~ -18.3 cm. Well, you can't have a negative body length, and you also can't have a head that is zero cm.  It just doesn't make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the data table, the head lengths range from 24 cm to 61 cm. You have no business predicting the body length of a crocodile whose head length is outside of this range, because you don't have enough data to be accurate.\n",

    "During an archaeological dig in northwest Africa, an 87 cm skull from a juvenile sarcosuchus (an extinct genus of crocodile from a distant relative of living crocodiles, believed to have lived 112 million years ago) was discovered. You want to estimate the body length of this crocodilian using the regression equation you calculated for the estuarine crocodiles.\n",

    "![A drawing of a sarcosuchus, an extinct genus of crocodile that is believed to have lived one hundred and twelve million years ago.](Media/L01-04.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to ignore for a moment that making this estimate will require extrapolation (guesstimating), because in the absence of anything else to help you predict, it seems to be the best approach. Besides, extrapolation on the high side of the range is less risky than extrapolating on the low side. And all you are really trying to do anyway is estimate the length of an extinct crocodile. It is not likely to affect world peace.\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict the body length, you can substitute x = 87 into the regression equation, since the found skull was 87cm:\n",

You can answer these questions by looking at *residuals*. A residual in regression is simply the difference between the predicted y and the actual y.

    "## 2. Testing for Homoscedasticity\n",
    "\n",
    "*Homoscedasticity* basically means that at each level of the predictor variable, the error should be relatively constant. Approximately the same. Said another way, if you have homoscedasticity, you have equal variance for all levels of your independent variable. Error is just another word for residuals, so you want to see if the residuals are normally distributed for all the different levels of your IV. This can be done either with a histogram, or a Q-Q plot. The histogram is shown here:\n",

In this case, it is saying that knowing the value of any one of the y's doesn't tell you anything about any other data point. In other words, if a change in the value of a response is going to affect the value of another response variable, you have dependence; otherwise, there is independence.\n",

This year, the number of trick-or-treaters you get will depend on a lot of things, such as the weather, or the day of the week where Halloween falls, or whether or not there will be an awesome Halloween carnival at the park right next to your house until sundown, etc. But the number of trick-or-treaters will not depend on how many you had last year. It may be similar to what you had last year, but just because things are similar doesn't make them dependent on one another.\n",

If the data look like a random scattering of points, curved, or any other strange shape, there is no linear relationship in the data, and so it's not appropriate to run linear regression.  Start by looking at the scatterplot, to determine whether you have a linear relationship between your two variables.\n",

Then you can subtract your predicted values from your true values in a new item called ```residual```. \n",

    "You find your overall *F* value under ```F-Statistic``` in the righthand column, and underneath is the *p* value. The overall model is statistically significant, because the *p* value is less that .05, so you can then move on to interpreting other things.  You have your slope under ```coef``` in the middle table, as well as the associated *t* test and and *p* value for the significance of this particular independent variable in your model.  Because the *p* value is < .05, you can determine that ```PowerBoats``` has a significant effect on the number of manatee deaths.  By looking at the ```R-squared``` and ```Adj. R-squared``` in the upper right hand corner, you see that this model accounts for 94% of the variance in explaining manatee deaths.  \n",

    "* **Skew:** Again, you would like to see a value close to zero, and this result feeds into the Omnibus test discussed above.\n",
    "* **Kurtosis:** If you have a value close to zero, this means our data is relatively normal.\n",
    "* **Durbin-Watson:** This also tests for homoscedasticity! You would like a value between 1 and 2, otherwise you have the presence of heteroscedasticity within your data.\n",
    "* **Jarque-Bera (JB):** This also tests skew and kurtosis. It should also be close to zero.\n",
    "* **Prob (JB):** The probabilty that JB is normal.  You would like this to be close to zero as well.\n",

    "* In statistics, you write the linear regression equation as y = b<sub>1</sub>x + b<sub>0</sub> where b<sub>0</sub> is the y-intercept of the line and b<sub>1</sub> is the slope of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear regression allows you to predict values of y for a given x. This is done by first calculating the coefficients b<sub>0</sub> and b<sub>1</sub> and then plugging in the desired value of x and solving for y.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The independent variable (x) is the variable that is not affected by what happens to the other variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dependent variable (y) is the variable that is affected by what happens to the other variable. It *depends* on  the independent variable. For example, in the correlation between the number of powerboats and the number of manatee deaths, the number of deaths is affected by the number of powerboats in the water, but not the other way around. So, you would assign x to represent the number of powerboats and y to represent the number of manatee deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The true linear regression line is y = β<sub>1</sub>x + β<sub>0</sub> where β<sub>0</sub> is the true y-intercept of the line and β<sub>1</sub> is the true slope of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A residual is the difference between the observed value of y for a given x and the predicted value of y on the regression line for the same x.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To check all the assumptions for linear regression, you will need to create a scatterplot of x and y, a residual plot, and a Q-Q plot of the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To conduct a hypothesis test to determine whether there is a linear relationship between two variables, test the slope (β<sub>1</sub>) to see whether it is equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The appropriate hypotheses for this test are:\n",

The effects of gravity cause that our height measured at the end of the day is less than our height measured at the beginning of the day.  Fortunately, at night, our bodies stretch out again, so that from one morning to the next, each of us has returned to the morning height from the day before.\n",
