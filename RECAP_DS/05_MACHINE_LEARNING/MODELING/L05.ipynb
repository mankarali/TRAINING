Sometimes this can be a tedious process, especially if data are collected very slowly. However, some models lend themselves to being tested by simulating what will happen using random numbers. In these situations, testing a model becomes a statistical exercise instead of a painstaking waiting game.\n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout this lesson, you will use functions to generate random numbers. The science of generating random numbers is actually a lot more complicated than you might suspect, since humans are particularly bad at thinking of random numbers off the top of their heads. The key to randomness is that every output has an equal probability of occurring. If you were to select 10,000 of your closest friends and ask each of them to come up with a random number between 1 and 10, and then you made a histogram of their responses, you might be surprised at the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "If humans could truly generate random numbers off the top of their head, you would expect the histogram of 10,000 random numbers from 1 to 10 to look something like this:\n",

    "![A histogram of ten thousand random numbers from one to ten. The height of vertical bars of the histogram are all very close to each other.](Media/L05-01.png)\n",

    "![A bar graph with an x axis ranging from one to twenty. The y axis ranges from zero percent to twenty percent. A key shows that dark blue bars represent human.

    "\n",
    "In this example, numbers from 1 to 20 were generated both by a computer (light blue bars), and by humans (dark blue bars). The graph indicates that when generating \"random\" numbers, the number 17 gets picked a lot more often than if the numbers were randomly selected - about 3x more likely! That's a pretty good indication that humans don't pick random numbers! Most studies indicate that humans are much more likely to choose numbers in the middle of the possible values than on the ends of the possible values. Either way, it is a mistake to depend on humans to create random variables, which is why you'll explore computer methods in this lesson!\n",

For instance, you might want to simulate a coin toss.  There are only two options there - heads or tails.  You can't get anything else, like feet or stomachs. Other examples of discrete distributions are the roll of a 6-sided die, or the drawing of a card from a standard deck of playing cards. In each of these cases, it is common to simply take the uniform distribution and break it into the number of possible outcomes, and then map the outcome for an individual trial to the discrete variable. \n",

If you only need to do it once to make a decision, that is no big deal - you just grab a coin from your pocket or purse, or from that one dish you have in the kitchen and flip it, then record the results. Well, what if the project calls for 5 coin flips? Still no big deal, right? Just flip the coin 5 times and record the results. But suppose you need to flip the coin 10,000 times! Even if you were inclined to do that by hand, it would take a long time. Even if you could get it down to 5 flips per minute (including the time waiting for the coin to stop bouncing or spinning, and then recording the result), that is 2000 minutes worth of work, which is 33 hours and 20 minutes, and that doesn't account for bathroom breaks, sleeping, or eating.\n",
