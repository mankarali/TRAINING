    "## An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at an example. The following spreadsheet shows results for 20 students that took an exam. The data collected are the amount of time spent studying for the exam, and whether or not they passed the exam:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A spreadsheet with two columns, hours and outcome. Rows beneath the hours heading the amount of time a student studied for an exam. The rows beneath the outcome heading show fail or pass.](Media/L02-02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Do some eyeball analysis on these data for a few minutes. Even though the data set is pretty limited, it seems that studying for 1.5 hours or less is a recipe for failure. On the other hand, everyone who studied 4 hours or more passed the test. It's difficult to say with anyone who studied between 1.5 and 4 hours, though. Without doing much math yet, create a simple model that would help explain the likelihood of passing the exam. Set up a graph to try and model the probability of passing the exam, based on the amount of study. Here is what you know for sure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A graph showing the probability of passing an exam based on hours of study. The x axis is labeled hours of study and runs from zero to seven in increments of one. The x axis is also labeled fail. A horizontal line at the top of the graph is labeled pass. On the fail line, a thick red line runs from zero to one point five. On the pass line, a thick red line runs from four to seven.](Media/L02-03.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the thick red lines represents whether a student passes or fails based on study time, then anything between 1.5 hours and 4 hours is variable. If you stick with the thought that more study improves your chances of passing, you might just simply connect the two horizontal lines, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A graph showing the probability of passing an exam based on hours of study. The x axis is labeled hours of study and runs from zero to seven in increments of one. The x axis is also labeled fail. A horizontal line at the top of the graph is labeled pass. On the fail line, a thick red line runs from zero to one point five. The line then moves upward on the chart to the pass line. On the pass line, a thick red line runs from four to seven.](Media/L02-04.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now add a scale to the vertical axis, going from 0 (fail) to 1 (pass):\n",
    "\n",
    "![A graph showing the probability of passing an exam based on hours of study. The x axis is labeled hours of study and runs from zero to seven in increments of one.

    "Now you can make some statements about probability. For instance, you might ask \"What is the probability of passing, assuming that I study for 3.25 hours?\" To answer this based on your 'non-mathematical' model, you simply draw a vertical line straight up from 3.25 until it intersects with the thick red line. At that point, the line should be drawn horizontally and to the left, until it hits the vertical axis, like the green line added below:\n",

On the fail line, a thick red line runs from zero to one point five. The line then moves upward on the chart to the pass line. On the pass line, a thick red line runs from four to seven. A dotted green line runs from left to right, starting on the y axis just below zero point seven five. When it hits the upward diagonal red line, the dotted green line runs directly downward to the x axis, at about three point two five.](Media/L02-06.png)\n",

    "Even though this is different from the 'best fit' line you created in the linear regression lesson, can you see how it is sort of a 'best fit' in a sense, given the parameters within which you are working?\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Meets minimum sample size of having at least one case per cell, with no more than 20% of cells having less than five cases. \n",
    "    > What is meant by cells? If you made a 2x2 chart of the actual and predicted outcomes, you should have at least 1 case in each. \n",
    "2. Linearity in the logit\n",
    "3. Absence of multicollinearity\n",
    "4. Absence of outliers \n",
    "5. Independence of errors\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn about them all in-depth below.\n",

    "## 2. Linearity in the Logit\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, the *logit*, also known as the *log-odds*, is the logarithm (log) of the odds of the probability of your outcome.  You need to make sure that the logit is linearly related to the independent variable. This can be done via graph once you have created the logit term.\n",

    "## 3. Absence of Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "You will test for the absence of multicollinearity for a logistic regression the exact same way you would for a linear regression - just correlate the independent variables, and if they are too highly correlated (.6/.7ish or higher) than you probably have related independent variables and thus the presence of multicollinearity.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 5. Independence of Errors \n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption of independent errors just means that your residuals cannot be related to any part of our data.

This is a case of a quantitative predictor variable, and a categorical response variable.\n",

Therefore, you'll be shown just how to create the model; but beware! Without testing assumptions, you will not be able to definitively say that the results are accurate.  Only use Python for logistic regression when the stakes aren't very high and you just need to get an idea of what will happen.\n",

However, in the grand scheme of things, just looking at the number of home runs alone does not seem to have a huge impact, since by looking at the ```Pseudo R-squared``` value, you can see that home runs only explain just under 4% of the variance in winning and losing baseball games.  *Pseudo R-Squared* is very similar to the Multiple R-Squared in regression in interpretation; however, it is calculated differently because you are using logistic  regression, which is why it retains the moniker \"pseudo.\"\n",
