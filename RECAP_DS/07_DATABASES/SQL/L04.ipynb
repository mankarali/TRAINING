    "Defining the structure of your table is essential to storing your data in an efficient and meaningful way. *Columns* are the most essential part of the table, this is where the actual data will live. You will define these columns (also called fields), with a datatype that you deem appropriate for the data you wish to store. A good choice for a name, for instance, would be a `VARCHAR(50)`, with the number in the parentheses indicating the maximum number of characters that any given name may have. A good choice for storing a date of birth might be `DATE`, while `INTEGER` may be the best choice for the model year of a vehicle. Be sure to choose appropriately here, as changing any of these types could be a cumbersome undertaking if a significant amount of data has been stored in the table.\n",

    "\n",
    "To review what you have learned so far, `Null` is a value that is undefined. Because of this, attempts to compare values to a field that contains a `NULL` value will fail. The only operation that works on this value is the binary evaluation of `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`. As applied to tables, this is whether a column in your table can contain the value `NULL` or not. The keywords are either `NULL`, or `NOT NULL` appended to the datatype that follows the column name when you create the table. For instance: `FirstName varchar(50) NOT NULL` would indicate that the `FirstName` column should never be undefined. A practical application of using NULLs would be something like a voluntary survey â€“ perhaps the applicant chose not to answer ethnicity.  So you could store `NULL` in that column when you save the data to indicate that there was no selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a table is critical. You will be working mainly with the rows and columns of the tables in a database. Tables can be related to Excel spreadsheets. The columns define the data needed, and the rows list out the data for each object in the database. Below is a MS Excel spreadsheet with information about specific animals in a pet store.

This will enable you, when working in other tables, to identify that the data is related to the original table. For example, a customer table may have an id column that is a primary key. You could then use that customer id in a table that lists purchases, to relate a particular purchase to an individual customer account. **Almost all tables should have a primary key.** Without a primary key, there is no way to identify each row uniquely.\n",

Natural is when the Primary Key is assigned to a piece of data that already exists in the record, and will always be unique for each record. An example of this could be a Social Security Number. If you had employees in your database, every employee would have a unique SSN. A Surrogate is a Primary Key that doesn't have anything to do with the actual data. Up until this point, you have been using a Surrogate Primary Key by assigning an ID number to your customers or users. Surrogate Primary Keys are becoming more popular these days mainly because the cost of having a database with a significant amount of data is not nearly as expensive as it used to be. In the past, companies would save money by using a Natural key. Problems would arise when that Social Security Number of an employee changes, because that can and has happened. That could potentially break anything that is linked to that employee by his/her SSN. To wrap up, Surrogate keys are used more and more because that data has nothing to do with the actual record except to give it a unique piece of data.\n",

    "`CHECK` is an expression that you create that will check each entry into the table for validation.  If the entry fails the constraint, then the update or insert will fail. An example here would be a check constraint that would validate a phone or zip has the right number of digits, and that they were in fact digits instead of text. Here is an example:\n",

A common use for this scenario is an Inserted column that you might have in your table, to indicate when the record was written. You might set the default constraint to the `datetime()` function, which would populate the date and time (local time, not UTC) of when the record was created in the table.

A common usage would be an 'after' trigger, which would be executed 'after' an insert, update or delete. You could use a trigger of this sort to capture the values changing in the table and send them to a log table for historical usage, to see how the values in the table have changed in the past. Triggers are usually found on smaller databases and not so much on larger ones, as the overhead and resource contention caused by triggers fired off continually can adversely impact performance to an extreme degree.\n",

It contains rows and columns, just like a real table, but when a view is created, a table is NOT created; you are just showing the output of the selected data. The fields in the View are from one or more real tables that exist in the database. You can use SQL functions, `WHERE`, and `JOIN` statements in a view to be able to present the data as if it were coming from one table.\n",
