If your collection exceeds 20 documents, then the first 20 will be shown, and you will need to type `it` to continue iterating to the next 20 documents. In large collections of millions of documents, you can see how this would be impossible to find the documents you're looking for - and that is where the query operators come in.\n",

    "# Projection Document\n",
    "\n",
    "You've done many different queries at this point and introduced quite a few operators that you can mix and combine in various ways to return the data you searched for. But in every case, the queries have always returned the entire document from the collection specified. In some cases, you may want to return only one or a few fields from a document rather than the whole thing. That is where `projections` come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you remember, the syntax for the `find()` query looks like below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "db.collectionName.find({query, projection})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not include `projections` in your `find()` operation, you will get the entire document and all its fields as you've seen in every example so far. The syntax for projections is as follows, subject to some simple rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "db.collection.find( { query }, { field: <value>, field : <value>, etc} )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<value>` can be either a `1` or a `0`. The `1` indicated that you want to show the field, and the `0` indicates that you do not want to show the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using projections, you cannot have two fields where one includes a field and the other is excluding fields. For example, if you run the below query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "db.appusers.find( { _id : 2}, { firstName: 1, lastName: 0 })\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Error: error: {\n",
    "\"ok\" : 0,\n",
    "\"errmsg\" : \"Projection cannot have a mix of inclusion and exclusion.\",\n",
    "\"code\" : 2,\n",
    "\"codeName\" : \"BadValue\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you wanted to include the `firstName` only in your query result set and nothing else, it would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "db.appusers.find( { _id : 25}, { firstName: 1 })\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you wanted to find only the `firstName` and `lastName` fields for all documents and nothing else, you can run the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "db.appusers.find({}, {firstName : 1, lastName : 1})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the first and last names of all your documents are listed, paired with their `ObjectId` numbers. If you don't want to see the `_id` but want to see all other fields, you can define that with a projection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "db.appusers.find({}, { _id : 0})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And there you have it: All fields except for the `_id` when documents contain those fields.\n",
