    "# Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sharding** is a way to spread data across multiple machines and servers. MongoDB uses Sharding to support deployments and applications that contain huge data sets. This is because when database systems have large data sets, a single server may have trouble keeping up with all the data. There are _two_ ways to deal with a situation like this: *Vertical* or *Horizontal* Scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vertical Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vertical Scaling** involves ways to increase the capacity of a server, such as using a much more powerful CPU, adding more RAM, or increasing the amount of storage space. There are limitations when using _Vertical Scaling_ because there may be restrictions on how much storage one machine can handle. Also, cloud-based providers have a maximum for how much storage they have.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Horizontal Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Horizontal Scaling** is the process of spreading out the dataset between multiple servers and increasing the storage to those servers as needed. Even if a single machine out of the many handling the data may not be super high-speed, overall, it may increase the efficiency of the application having many machines. If the dataset expands, all that is needed is to add servers to handle that data as needed. MongoDB supports _Horizontal Scaling_ through _Sharding_.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enable Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sharding** is something that is done at a very high level in your database, usually on the admin side of the database. The following command is used when you would like to create Sharding in your database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "db.runCommand({\n",
    "   shardCollection: \"<database>.<collection>\",\n",
    "   key: <shardkey>,\n",
    "   unique: <boolean>,\n",
    "   numInitialChunks: <integer>,\n",
    "   collation: { locale: \"simple\" }\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are several options available to you when running this command; however, only the last is optional. Now it's time to explore these parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **shardCollection:** How do you name which collection in which database you would like to shard. It will always be a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **key:** The index specification document to use as the shard key. The shard key determines how MongoDB distributes the documents among the shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **unique:** When true, the unique option ensures that the underlying index enforces a unique constraint. Hashed shard keys do not support unique constraints. Defaults to false.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **numInitialChunks:** Specifies the number of chunks to initially create when sharding a collection that is empty with a hashed shard key. Then, MongoDB will create and balance chunks across the cluster. The `numInitialChunks` must be less than 8192 per shard.\n",
    "  * MongoDB divides sharded data into chunks. Each chunk has an inclusive lower and exclusive upper range based on the shard key.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **collation:** _Optional._ If the collection specified to shardCollection has a default collation, you must include a collation document with `{ locale : \"simple\" }`, or the shardCollection command fails. At least one of the indexes whose fields support the shard key pattern must have a simple collation.\n",
    "  * Collation allows users to specify language-specific string comparison rules, such as letter case and accent marks.\n",

    "It's been about a month since you have inserted all employees into the database. There have been a couple of changes to the company. The CEO decided that he no longer wants remote employees, so they have transferred the remote employees and they are now living in Arizona. Alison Davidson now lives at 777 E. 1st St. # 120 Tempe, AZ and Mary Crawley now lives at 8322 W. Vista Pl. Scottsdale, AZ. Since all employees now all live in Arizona, there is no need to have a field named \"state\" within this collection, so please remove it. Lastly, they would like very efficient searching using the \"position\" field (remember that field includes a document with three other fields).\n",
