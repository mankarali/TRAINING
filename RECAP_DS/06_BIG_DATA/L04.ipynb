    "*Pig* is another query system built on top of Hadoop and MapReduce, similar to Hive.  However, while Hive uses SQL, Pig uses a SQL-like language, called PigLatin. No joke! You have the option to run it with either the built-in Hadoop system, or with TEZ to make things go faster. Just like Hive, Pig is extremely flexible, and you can create your own user-defined functions if you'd like. Pig calls datasets *relations*.  They behave in much the same manner as Hive tables, but of course everyone needs to express their individuality with their own naming conventions!\n",

    "\tAS (bookID:int, authors:chararray, average_rating:float, isbn:chararray, isbn13:chararray, language_code: chararray, num_pages:int, ratings_count: int, text_reviews_count:int);\n",

    "You use the ```LOAD``` function to specify exactly where data is stored on your HDFS, and then tell it to parse the data, with the command ```USING PigStorage()```.  ```','``` goes in the parentheses in this case, because your data is comma delimited, but if you were doing other data parsed other ways, you would need to put in another delimiter type.\n",
    "\n",

Next, you create an object that will give you back the title and the book id for every row.  This is done using the ```FOREACH``` and ```GENERATE``` commands, which you can think of like a Pig version of a for loop.  It takes the same \"for this\" format, but instead of \"in that,\" you have \"do this.\"  So this next line of code below says, \"for each row of metadata, put in the book id and the title, and call it all bookStuff.\"\n",

    "```\n",

    "```pig\n",
    "fiveStarBooks = FILTER avgRatings by avgRating > 4.0;\n",

    "# HBase\n",
    "\n",
    "*HBase* is a non-relational, transactional database built on top of HDFS.  There is no query language that goes with HDFS, but there is an API that allows you to perform CRUD operations using HBase. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## HBase Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "HBase has two components to it: *region* servers, which contain groups of keys that can automatically grow and re-partition as needed, and *master servers*, which keep track of everything that's going on with the region servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other non-relational databases, in HBase, every row is a reference to a unique key.  However, HBase has the ability to store data in *column families* instead of just key-value pairs.  Each column family can contain multiple related individual columns.  For instance, you might have a column family named address, and stored inside are columns for street number, street name, city name, state name, and zip code. HBase excels at dealing with missing data, since it does not take up space within a column if no data populates that column.  \n",
    "\n",
    "HBase also has something called a *cell*, which is the intersection of a row and a column.  You can store multiple versions of each cell to get an idea of the history if data is being updated.  History can include a timestamp as well, so you know exactly when a change occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Access HBase\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access HBase from a wide variety of applications! From the easiest to the most complicated, you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hive\n",
    "* Pig\n",
    "* Spark\n",
    "* HBase shell\n",
    "* Java API that includes wrappers for other languages such as Python or Scala\n",
    "\n",
    "Hive, Pig, and Spark also allow you to process data within their program and then output it to HBase, which is helpful.\n",

In order to do that, open up your ```Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager```, and right click on your ```Hortonworks Docker Sandbox```.
