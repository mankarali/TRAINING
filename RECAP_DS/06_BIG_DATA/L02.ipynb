    "# Introduction to HDFS\n",
    "\n",
    "HDFS is the main place where your data gets stored in Hadoop and it is also responsible for distributing your data across the cluster so that you can access it quickly and reliably.  It handles big files by breaking them into blocks, which are set as 128 mb by default, though you can change that setting.  If you have less data than 128 mb, then you only need one data block. This means that HDFS can store files that are bigger than what an individual hard drive can store. If you need more space, you can always add *commodity computers*, which is just a fancy way of saying \"buy or rent more virtual space.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## HDFS Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an idea of what is going on behind the scenes, examine the image below, focusing right now on the HDFS layer on the bottom:\n",
    "\n",
    "![High level architecture of Hadoop. The master node has task tracker, job tracker, name node, and data node. There are two slave nodes and they have a task tracker and a data node. A horizontal dottel line divides the task tracker and data node in all the three nodes. The above portion of the horizontal line is labeled map reduce layer and below portion is labeled HDFS layer. The job tracker on the master node is connected to all the taskt trackers and the name node in the master node is connected to all the data nodes.](Media/bigData5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is showing how HDFS is broken up.  There is a *name node*, which is in charge of keeping track of everything.  You can think of it as a version of a master node.  The name node contains a large table with all the different file names you have in your cluster, as well as an edit log, so that it is tracking where each file is at any one time and what has happened to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you have the *data node*, which is just HDFS' name for a little worker bee.  The data node is where the file block is actually stored.  In the case of big data, there is ordinarily more than one data node, and each of the data nodes can talk to each other to maintain copies of the other blocks as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading a File\n",
    "\n",
    "Beneath the surface, whenever you read or work with a file, your node (the *client node*) will send a message to the name node, which will state where the file is, and then the client node will hop over to the data node(s) and retrieve the data required for the particular operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing a File\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a file, beneath the surface, here is what Hadoop is doing: the client node will reach out the name node and ask it to create a new entry.  Then the client node will go to the data node(s) and tell it that new data is being written.  The data nodes will then communicate with each other to create a backup of all the data blocks on different data nodes, to ensure reliability.  Then that information is sent back to the name node so that it knows what just happened and where everything is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## HDFS Resilience\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may be concerned about the fact that there is only one name node.  How can you have fault tolerance when all the controls rest in one node's hands? Well, listed below, are a number of ways in which you can work with Hadoop to deal with this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Constant metadata backups:** You can backup your metadata constantly, so that you can always restore to an edit log.  You may lose a little bit of work, but it shouldn't be much.\n",
    "* **Secondary name node:** A secondary name node will maintain a merged copy of the edit log with the primary name node.\n",
    "* **HDFS Federation:** When you have so much data that one name node isn't enough, you can create an HDFS federation that spreads out the logs of the name node into multiple.  This means that if a name node goes down, you only lose the information off that one name node, not all of it.\n",
    "* **HDFS High Availability:** Multiple name nodes trade off their work and are always on alert if the other goes down.  This is managed through Zookeeper.\n",

    "```cd``` stands for \"change directory\" and is used to navigate to and from different folders. First, if you run the command ```cd ..``` that will bring you back one step from where you are located. From running ```pwd```, you saw that you were in the /home/ubuntu directory. Run ```cd ..``` to navigate to the home directory. If you run ```pwd``` again, you will see that you are no longer within the ubuntu user but are just in the home. See below:\n",

Go ahead and try it. Cd back one step (```cd ..```), run ```pwd``` to see your directory (which should be /home), and then run ```cd ~```.

If you type `3fk`, that will find and move you to the third occurrence of the character `k`.

For example, if you wanted to create an underline with 30 dashes `-`, you don't need to type out 30 dashes. You can use `30i-Esc` and that will do it for you. The `30` defines how many times you want the word/character repeated, the `i` will put `Vim` into insert mode, the `-` is the character you want to be repeated, and the `Esc` will return to normal mode and execute the insertion of the 30 dashes.\n",
