    "Any process that can be monitored using an SPC chart is eligible to be evaluated for capability. Recall that any process has some inherent variability in it. If the process is running consistently and behaving well, you can determine the extent of variability by using an SPC chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is another set of important limits in a control strategy, called *spec limits*. The word \"spec\" is an abbreviated form of \"specification,\" and is universally written and spoken as \"spec.\" In the strictest of terms, a spec limit is a limit beyond which material is usually no good and has to be scrapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at an example: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Suppose you work for a company that makes wire for very high-end applications. The wire is very fine and high-purity. The application in which the wire is used is such that if the wire gets too thick, the resistance is too high, and the electronic parts containing the wire will not function properly. On the other end of the spectrum, if the wire gets too thin, the reliability of the part is not good because the electronic signal is not consistent.\n",

    "## Process Capability \n",
    "\n",
    "Process capability has two parts, which are compared: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Control Width:** A measure of variability of the process. You can think of this as the distance between the upper control limit (UCL) and the lower control limit (LCL). Control limits are calculated.\n",
    "* **Spec Limit:** The variability of the specification or tolerance of the process. This is determined to be the distance from the *upper spec limit* (USL) and the *lower spec limit* (LSL). Spec limits are set. \n",

    "---\n",

    "## Spec Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "Spec limits are determined based on any one of the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some sort of physical limitation based on downstream need.\n",
    "* Personal tolerance as determined by a manager.\n",
    "* Personal tolerance as determined by a customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will examine each of these criteria in depth.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Tolerance Determined by Customer\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a small business makes tags to be used on the front of control panels. The control panels have dozens of lights, gauges, and dials, and each needs a tag to identify the location being monitored. It might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A control panel full of buttons, switches, and lights.](Media/L05-01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of the tags are sold to a customer who has specific size needs, and so the width of the tags must be between 2.25 and 2.5 inches wide. They simply won't accept tags outside of those limits. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tolerance Determined by Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "A manager for a call center has determined that service calls need to last between four minutes and 12 minutes, since shorter calls are often an indication that the call center person has not had enough time to make a \"personal connection\" with the caller, and more than 12 minutes is an indication that the call center person is not working efficiently. However, these time limits may be very different than what another manager might put into place in the same situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tolerance Determined by Downstream Need\n",
    "\n",
    "On an automobile assembly line, there are all sorts of tolerances required by downstream processes. For example, on the frame of the car, there are engine mounts. If the engine mounts aren't in the right place, it makes no difference how beautiful the finish work on the mounts may be, because the line won't be able to install an engine into the auto frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Is out of Spec Truly Bad?\n",
    "\n",
    "If something is \"out of spec,\" it is typically not used, which would imply that the material is garbage. This may or may not be the case. In the case of the call center worker who likes to gab, and therefore his phone calls are all \"out of spec,\" he may have the highest customer satisfaction rank in the call center. His calls aren't garbage; they are just longer than the manager wants them to be. For the small company making tags for control panels, there might be other customers that want tags that are between 2.5 inches and 2.6 inches, so the tags that are too large for their main customer might be just right for another customer. However, for the auto assembly line, if the engine mounts are in the wrong place, it is likely that the car frame would literally be scrapped, and melted down to raw steel, awaiting fabrication into a new auto frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many industries, there are secondary markets where material that is out of spec will be sold at a deep discount and used somewhere else. This happens in the semiconductor industry all the time. Did you ever wonder why a child's toy that costs just a couple dollars could have multiple semiconductors in it? It is not because the toy manufacturer is taking a huge loss on each toy, it is because the toy manufacturer doesn't need a computer chip that is pristine. The chip might be half dead or more, and not suitable at all for a computer, but it is adequate for the toy, and the toy manufacturer can get it for a nickel, rather than the $250 price tag on the fully functional chip.\n",

    "# Calculating Process Capability with the Capability Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The capability of a process is usually expressed using a single number, called the *capability index*. There are actually a couple of different flavors of capability indices, which you will get to in a few minutes. For now, you will investigate the theoretical approach to capability and what it means in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The symbol for a capability index is C<sub>p</sub>. It is calculated using this simple formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The formula for capability index. C sub P equals U S L minus L S L divided by six sigma.](Media/L05-02.png)\n",

    "![A normal distribution with vertical lines showing the mean and three standard deviations below and above the mean.](Media/L05-03.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will expect virtually all of the data to be between x-bar - 3 stdev and x-bar + 3 stdev. In other words, the width of almost all of the data is about 6 standard deviations, or 6 sigma. That is also where the UCL and LCL are located, so in essence, the formula for C<sub>p</sub> becomes: \n",
    "\n",
    "![C sub P equals U S L minus L S L divided by U C L minus L C L.](Media/L05-04.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you see that the formula for C<sub>p</sub> is simply a ratio of the spec width to the control width? Spec width is in the numerator (the top part of the fraction) and control width is in the denominator (the bottom part of the fraction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the capability index C<sub>p</sub> can be illustrated using a histogram to represent the process and its control limits, and then using vertical bars to indicate the spec limits. It would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A normal distribution. The L C L and the U C L are indicated by vertical bars extending downward, and the width between them is labeled control width.

    "\n",
    "In this situation, you can see that the spec limits are completely outside of the control limits. This scenario is ideal. Remember, C<sub>p</sub> is a measure of where the process _does_ run compared to where the process _needs_ to run.\n",

    "\n",
    "* C<sub>p</sub> less than 1 means the process is not capable\n",

    "Can you see how C<sub>p</sub> doesn't really account for much except the ratio of the spec width to the control width? For this reason, C<sub>p</sub> is often called the process potential. Rather than C<sub>p</sub> being a great indicator of what is going on, it is more commonly used as an indicator of what could be going on if the process was centered up in the middle of the spec width.\n",

    "When a process is out of control, that presents a different environment and requires a different plan of attack than for when a process is out of spec. When a process is out of control, it is broken. Something has fallen apart and needs to be fixed. This often requires someone who is familiar with the process to troubleshoot and figure out what is broken. On the other hand, when a process is out of spec, it simply isn't good enough. Either your process is not centered in the right place, or it needs to be replaced with a better process. That requires engineering. If someone does not understand that \"out of control\" and \"out of spec\" require different solutions, they are likely to apply the wrong solution. This is especially true for a process that is out of spec. If your process is out of spec, but not out of control, then it is not broken. In other words, you would be trying to fix a process that is not broken. In previous lessons, you referred to this activity as tampering. When you tamper, you are taking a process that was in control but out of spec and turning it into a process that is now out of control **and** out of spec. You've made things worse.\n",

    "![In spec, in control, your process is fine, do nothing. In spec, out of control, your process is broken and needs to be fixed. Out of spec and in control, your process is not good enough and needs to be re engineered. Out of spec and out of control, you have lots of problems.](Media/L05-17.png)\n",
