    "In a business setting, data scientists  are often relied upon to be the expert on creating and monitoring company metrics. This is another area of data science where business acumen plays a big role, and this is difficult to teach in a classroom setting; it is often learned on the job. However, there are some basic principles related to the creation, development, and monitoring of metrics that are pretty global. This module will touch on many of these principles.\n",

    "# Overview of Business Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution of a business from an idea, to a start-up, to a small business, to a multi-national corporation has been thoroughly documented for thousands of companies. Some businesses take decades to go through these steps, while others do it in a matter of a few short years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The road is also littered with a million carcasses of failed businesses that couldn't transition from one step to the next or couldn't execute at their current step.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no sure path, no \"one way\" to be successful. But for all companies that find some level of success, the vast majority of them will create a mission statement with accompanying vision statements, goals, ideals, etc. that are intended (usually by management) to be the motivational force for the entire company.  After these driving forces have been created, what usually follows is a desire to measure how well a company is adhering to these lofty ideals. This is the foundation of business metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also where the problems start. Mission statements are often vague and ideological. They make for great slogans or banners at an employees pep rally, but they are hard to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the workplace, it is common to hear mandates that say things like \"...we won't work on anything that cannot be traced back to one of our core values.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vision Statement Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The Coca-Cola Company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. The flagship product was invented in 1886 by a pharmacist named John Pemberton. As of this writing, in 2017, the Coca-Cola Company has grown into a worldwide conglomerate of companies and acquisitions. Most of the acquisitions are beverage companies, but in the 1980s Coca-Cola even bought Columbia Pictures, which they later sold for a tremendous profit. The current market cap of Coca-Cola is just shy of 200 billion dollars. By just about any measure, most would agree that Coca-Cola has been wildly successful. The intent here is not to pick on Coca-Cola. It's intended to illustrate the challenge a data scientist faces when tasked with the responsibility of trying to convert a mission statement into measurable metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you curious about their mission statement, and vision statements? Check these out: \n",
    "\n",

    "* To refresh the world...\n",
    "* To inspire moments of optimism and happiness...\n",
    "* To create value and make a difference.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### To Refresh the World\n",
    "\n",
    "Huh? How on earth would you measure that? Maybe someone could figure out a way to determine what portion of the earth's population consumed one or more of their beverages each day, and measure the progress over time, but that seems difficult to accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or maybe someone could invent some sort of \"refresh\" ray-gun type monitor, and discretely point it at random people to measure their level of \"refreshness\" before and after consuming one of their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### To Inspire Moments of Optimism and Happiness\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, this just got harder. There are visual cues for happiness; most people smile when they are happy. Maybe smiles on those who pass by could be recorded, and see if they are more frequent when you are carrying a Coke. Now for the optimism part, you'll have to think about that for a bit...\n",
    "\n",

    "### To Create Value and Make a Difference\n",

    "A difference in what? Value in what? Shareholder value? Okay, that is easy to measure. But if that is not what they mean, then who knows?\n",
    "\n",
    "The point is that these types of mission statements are rarely directly measurable. It would sure be a lot easier if their mission statement looked something like this instead:\n",

    "* To increase sales throughout the world...\n",
    "* To inspire moments of corporate optimism by crushing our competitors through increased market share, and moments of happiness for our managers whose bonus structures depend on gross revenues...\n",
    "* To create value for our stockholders and make a difference in their 401k.\n",

    "* New beverages can be introduced through taste-testing.  That is a data scientist's playground.\n",
    "* Profits can easily be measured and tracked, and almost every company does so relentlessly.\n",
    "* Productivity can also be measured and improved through new technologies and better processes - these are both areas where a data scientist can really make a difference.\n",
    "* As far as people, partners, and the planet go, those sound a bit esoteric to be put into metrics directly. Most companies want to be known as \"a great place to work,\" and many claim they are...but how do you measure that?\n",
    "* And what about partners...how do you measure whether or not you have a \"winning\" network, and whether you are creating \"mutual, enduring value?\"\n",
    "* Lots of companies want to be known as being good for the planet. It is good PR. But how exactly should they measure that?\n",
    "* And unless the employees of a company are literally picking up hammers and building a community, what sort of metrics would help a company monitor whether they are being responsible citizens, helping build and support sustainable communities?\n",

    "## Values Example\n",

    "![Coca cola values. Leadership, the courage to shape a better future. Collaboration, leverage collective genius. Integrity, be real. Accountability, if it is to be, its up to me. Passion, committed in heart and mind. Diversity, as inclusive as our brands. Quality, what we do, we do well.](Media/L01-10.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Key Performance Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "Many businesses use a lot of fancy terms to drive their metrics. There can be many subtle differences from business-to-business. However, there are a lot of similarities, too. You will learn about these metrics in more general terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most companies talk about things like: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Performance measurements\n",
    "* Performance metrics\n",
    "* Process indicators\n",
    "* Performance indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies might make a big deal about distinguishing the differences between these phrases, and when you're working for a company, you will probably have to spend a bit of time learning the particulars of their wording. For instance, your company might have a very specific distinction between \"measurements\" and \"metrics.\" Nevertheless, the intent with each of these measurements is to monitor and/or improve corporate performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also pretty common for a company to distinguish between what are considered \"key\" indicators versus \"regular\" indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *key performance indicator*, often abbreviated as *KPI*, is a metric created to measure the strategic value drivers within a company. Leadership typically sets the KPIs, but departments, groups, sections, etc. are left to figure out for themselves what specific things they can do to meet corporate goals. Things that work towards KPIs are often given priority and/or funding; things that don't overtly work towards KPIs are not. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good KPI should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reflect the company's strategic core\n",
    "* Be defined by executives\n",
    "* Cascade through the organization\n",
    "* Be based on valid data\n",
    "* Be easily comprehended\n",
    "* Be relevant\n",
    "* Provide thresholds and targets\n",
    "* Empower front-line users\n",
    "* Leading to positive action\n",

    "\n",
    "It is usually in the hands of the data scientist to make sure these indicators are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Based on valid data:** The data scientist is usually the person or group at a company that is required to validate the data. This is a tedious exercise, but it carries a lot of weight. There will be many factions in a company that simply aren't reliable sources of data and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There is a lot of bias out there, and there are many agendas. As a data scientist, your agenda should always be \"listen to the data, and then make (or help others make) good decisions.\" There are cases where other entities will make their decisions, and then go and try to convince the data science group to present data that match their narrative. Doing this is usually a good way to fall out of favor among your peers.  You are strongly advised against it!\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relevant:** For better or worse, data scientists are expected to have fingertips on the pulse of what matters and what doesn't matter. A good example of this is if a company wants to reduce cosmetic defects in their packaging because they are convinced that customer satisfaction will be higher if they do. It will be up to you to pull data and evidence from other places to determine whether that's a good idea, or to test that idea once it's been implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Provide Thresholds and Targets:** The data scientist is the corporate \"data whisperer.\" You need to know how things behave, and be able to help establish operational thresholds and targets, with associated risk projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Empower Users:** As a data scientist, if you can get the front line people to buy into the fact that they have the power to make a company successful by paying attention to metrics and processes, you are probably working for a successful company.\n",

One of the most reliable sources of industry standard metrics is when there is a third party clearing house that monitors the industry. For instance, in healthcare, there is something called the Joint Commission that accredits hospitals and other healthcare facilities.  In addition to looking at things like cleanliness, they may also compare industry metrics and can be a reliable source.\n",

Having a metric of \"customer knowledge about our product\" is not specific enough. Instead, you could monitor through some means what proportion of customers actually read the instructions manual, which would be more specific.\n",

    "    There are as many as 15 to 20 steps in the order fulfillment process, and any one of them can cause a delay or a defect. The order processing guys look at the order as 20 segments (for example), because they want credit for successfully completing each step, and not just one credit for the entire process. So which metric is correct - fails per million orders, or fails per million segments? There is no right answer, but it is important that everyone agrees on what the metric means.\n",

    "* **Time-Based:** A goal must have set time parameters, especially when measuring the frequency of something.  Are you examining things each week? Each month? Each quarter? Each year? Pick a timeline in which you can reasonably expect to see changes over time; daily totals may not make much sense because things fluctuate a lot from day to day and it is easy to obscure a trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Further, the business world moves so quickly that if you are not getting feedback from your metrics in a timely manner, many become almost useless. If it takes you months to make a change that customers want, you run the risk of losing customers to a competitor who will make the change more quickly. There is not a lot of brand loyalty in the marketplace today. \n",
