    "## Destructive Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "There was once a young man who was involved in the Boy Scouts. One week, he was preparing for an upcoming camp out. He needed to bring some matches, and he found an old box of stick matches while digging through the cabinets in the kitchen. He wasn't really sure if the matches still worked, and there was no point in bringing the matches if they weren't going to help him start his evening campfire.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A lit match after being struck.](Media/L07-05.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing he could think of to do to test his matches was to simply try and light one. He picked a match, and struck it. After a couple of strikes, it burst into flames.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was satisfied that the match did in fact work, but then realized the test used rendered the match useless. The irony of the situation started to dawn on him - the only way to be absolutely sure that the match worked was to use it, after which time it wouldn't work anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "The story above is what you call a *destructive test*. There are lots of examples of destructive tests. They range from test firing rockets to doing quality assurance on food items. If you test fire a rocket to see if it fires properly with the correct thrust, balanced force, etc. you have consumed the rocket, and it is no good anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you work for a food manufacturer and are testing the nutritional value of a prepared food, you are probably involved in sampling the finished product line, and tearing open the package. Then the food goes into a blender, and several chemical composition tests are run on the \"homogenized\" food, looking for vitamin content, calorie content, fiber, and so forth. Clearly, the food cannot then be sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disruptive Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other means of measuring things that aren't destructive, but the method of completing the measurement actually alters that which is being measured. These are called *disruptive test*. The best example of this is a hand-held circuit tester.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are testing the resistance in an electrical circuit. The only practical way to do this is to use an ohm meter with test leads to measure the voltage drop across a device. However, the act of hooking up the meter actually changes the voltage drop across the device, so the resistance you are measuring is inaccurate by nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another example of a disruptive measurement. When you stick a thermometer into something to measure the temperature, you are actually changing the temperature. If you are cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving, the act of sticking a room temperature thermometer into a hot bird will actually decrease the temperature of the bird. The change will be very slight, but it changes nonetheless.\n",

Have you ever gone to the doctor and had to weigh yourself for your checkup, only to find that the scale at the doctor's office is about 4 lbs. heavier than your scale at home? Which scale is correct? Is it possible that neither is correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "When things are measured with non-destructive and non-disruptive tests, there is still **always** some error in the measurement. You can also use the words *variance* or *uncertainty* to describe the error. Among everything that can add to the variance in the measurement, the actual measurement device can also add to the variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of the measuring device might be off, and the ability for the device to give the same results for the same measurement might be off, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias** occurs when you have built-in error in measurement. There will always be built-in error measurement; your goal is to reduce it as much as possible. Suppose you were to take multiple measures of an object. For instance, suppose you have an experiment where you are adding two chemicals together, and waiting for the reaction to go to completion. You know the reaction is complete, because the solution changes color.\n",

    "\n",
    "What you didn't know is that the timer is broken. Because of an electronic glitch, the timer runs about five percent fast. So for a time duration of 40 seconds, the timer measures about 42 seconds. In other words, the reaction that was being measured actually went to completion in about 46.5 seconds or so.\n",

The most dangerous part about bias is that it is very difficult to detect. If the accuracy of your measurement isn't that critical, bias is no big deal. Everyone has used a bathroom scale that was a couple of pounds heavy - you just live with it.\n",

In manufacturing, a *gage repeatability and reproducibility (R&R)* study looks at this variability. These studies can help operators from making costly measurement errors. \n",

    "* **Repeatability:** The variation because of the *gage*, or measurement tool, itself.\n",
    "* **Reproducibility:** The variation from different people using the gage.\n",

    "## Total Variation\n",

    "Gage R&R determines the ratio of noise to total variation, which is called the *percentage of total variation* or *%TV*.  It also measures the size of the noise relative to the specification range, which is called the *percentage of tolerance*. Gage R&R also separates the variability into its sources: part-to-part variation, repeatability and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some benchmarks for the accuracy of a measuring system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Good:** Very low noise, preferably less than 1% of the total variability in your data, indicated as a gauge R&R of less than 10%.\n",
    "* **Questionable:** Noise between 1% and 9% of the total variability, or a gage R&R between 10% and 30%.\n",
    "* **Poor:** Noise greater than 9% of the total variation, or a gage R&R greater than 30%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from a gage R&R study can tell you where the system is broken and how to fix it.  If repeatability is high, but reproducibility is low, this means that the person doing the measuring is doing it the same way every time, but that the number isn't accurate.  If the reproducibility is high, but the repeatability is low, this means you need better operator training in the use of the gage, since the measurement tool is accurate, but the person doing the measuring is not.\n",

You can see that there is little chance of rejecting a good part or accepting a bad one except at the very edges of the specification limits. The graph in the middle shows a questionable system, with a gage R&R value of 14%.  Error is now much closer to the specification limits. Lastly, the graph on the right shows a poor system, with a gage of 32%. You'll note that errors are more common. \n",

It doesn’t matter who collects the data; however, it does matter that the operators never know which part they are measuring. This is called a *blinded study*. Giving parts numbers or letters to keep track of them, while keeping their true identity a secret to the operators is important, because operators can influence measurement with their prior knowledge and expectations. Even if an operator is consciously trying not to bias things, it can still happen. \n",

    "When referring to a survey, precision is known as *reliability*.  You are measuring the same concept over and over again.  There are several types of survey reliability.  *Inter-rater reliability* is the idea that the same person taking the survey again should score similarly. *Inter-item reliability* is the idea that all items on your survey scale are measuring the same thing.  You will soon learn how to calculate both in R, and examine closely a metric called *Chronbach's alpha*. \n",

    "Similarly, accuracy gets a new name as well when dealing with surveys: *validity*.  Validity is the idea that you are actually accurately measuring what you are supposed to be measuring.  Measuring the validity of a survey is a little trickier than measuring the reliability, as conceptually, you are trying to figure out whether you are measuring the thing you think you are! There are a few ways to go about it.  First, you can utilize comparisons to validate. For instance, if you have a survey on chronic pain, and you give it to those with chronic pain and pain-free controls, you would expect that those with chronic pain would score very highly on your survey, and those without any pain at all should score very, very low.  At gut-instinct level, if this is not the case, you know you have made a grave error in your survey design.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, you can compare your survey results to other surveys measuring similar things.  In the chronic pain survey example, you may want to compare your newly completed survey with others that have been out there for a long time, to see if the survey responses correlate well.  If they do, chances are you've got yourself a validated survey.  If they don't, it's time to go back to the drawing board, buddy!\n",
    "\n",
    "The third way to test for validity is through factor analysis. Factor analysis will determine how well your items hang together and whether there are any odd items out.  It can also help you determine if your items fall into subgroups.\n",

You may ask several questions about a similar broad topic, but is that all one topic, or does it really have some subtopics in it? *Factor analysis* has the answer to these questions and more! The basic goal of factor analysis is to see how items fall together and to see if they group in any particular patterns that make sense logically.\n",

    "## Types of Factor Analysis\n",

Exploratory factor analysis, abbreviated *EFA*, is used when you don't really have an inkling of what your data will yield.  You are intrepid explorers, traversing unknown survey data worlds! Confirmatory factor analysis, abbreviated *CFA* (so original!), is either for after you have completed EFA or when you are so confident about what your data holds you feel you can skip the EFA and just want a validation check. You are confirming your thoughts about the data with CFA. An example of when you might proceed straight to CFA is when you have already used a validated, previously studied set of survey items, and just want to make sure that your data is behaving the same way as it did for others.  \n",

    "### Sample Size \n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are many different opinions about sample size for EFA, the safest rule you can follow is to have at least 300 data points. However, you may be able to get away with as few as 150 data points if you have a small number of survey questions you're examining and those survey questions are moderately correlated with each other. \n",

    "### Absence of Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "*Multicollinearity*, or having a lot of overlap between variables, is a problem, because it will make sorting your survey items into distinct groups quite difficult.  Chances are that if your survey items all have really high multicollinearity, then you should have asked fewer survey items, because they are all getting at the same concept! You can test for multicollinearity by running a correlation matrix on all your survey items. If anything correlates with anything else at .9 or higher, than it's got to go, and you'll want to eliminate it from your analysis.  Though that's a good guideline, you may run into situations where lower correlations also cause problems.  You'll be able to catch this by looking at the *determinants*. You can think of determinants as another measure of how well survey items are correlated. When you run a determinant test, you are looking for a value of greater than .00001.    \n",

    "\n",
    "Although multicollinearity is to be avoided, it's important that there is some relationship between your survey items. Otherwise, they probably shouldn't be grouped together at all! So you'll also want to scan your correlation matrix for any variable that has multiple correlations with other items of .3 or lower, which is a good indication it's not going to play nicely with the others and should be removed. You can also run a catch-all test to make sure that there is some relation between all the variables - this is *Bartlett's test*, which you will want to be significant, since it tests against an *identity matrix*, or a matrix that assumes no relationship between all variables (correlations of 0 for everything).\n",

    "## Factor Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "The other big thing you need to know about EFA before diving in is *factor rotation*.  In order to better see the relationships between your different survey items, you will want to rotate the data.  You can rotate it 90 degrees, which is called *orthogonal rotation* and is really meant for when you theoretically don't think your survey items are related, or you can rotate it with *oblique rotation*, which does not maintain right angles at 90 degrees.  Oblique rotation is when you theoretically believe your survey items should be related. The most common types of orthogonal rotation are *varimax* and *quartimax*.  The most common types of oblique rotation are *oblimin* and *promax*. You don't need to know the mathematical differences between then, and chances are, you will use a process of trial and error in which you'll try at least two different rotation types for each data set.\n",

    "In the image below, you'll see that Figure A shows off the raw data, which is scattered all over the place.  Figure B, in the middle, shows a type of orthogonal rotation, in which the axes are now turned 90 degrees from where they once were.  And Figure C shows a type of oblique rotation, which also rotates the data, just not at 90 degrees.  In this example, the data remain spread apart (probably because there are only three data points), but in most cases, as you rotate, the data will start to clump together, forming factors.\n",

Since you will often have \"reversed\" items in a survey to try and catch your respondents unaware and give away fewer clues as to what you are measuring, you'll just need to do some wrangling afterwards to resolve this issue.\n",

    "## Interpret Output for Inter-Rater Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you'll need to look at for inter-rater reliability is Chronbach's alpha, which shows up on your R output as ```raw_alpha```.  Lucky for you, you don't actually have to collect the same survey from people twice to get a sense for inter-rater reliability (though it is an option, if you want to be thorough!). Chronbach's alpha does something called *split-half reliability*, which randomly splits the data in half for each person every possible way and then finds the correlation between them and takes the average, which is what R reports in ```raw_alpha```.  Typically, you want a Chronbach's alpha score of approximately .8 to have good reliability, however, it is based on the number of items in the scale or subscale, so interpreting it can be a little bit subjective.  Only have three items in your subscale? Then maybe a Chronbach's alpha score of about .7 is ok.  Have 30 items in your scale? Then .8 may not be looking so hot. The hard and fast rule, however, is that anything under .7 is probably not good reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that the ```raw_alpha``` score for ```goodFWB``` is alpha = .88, so the scale at first blush has pretty good reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Increasing your Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be able to increase your scale's reliability by dropping one or more items, because it doesn't play nice with the others.  This information is found in the ```Reliability if an item is dropped``` table in your R output. If the ```raw_alpha``` score in that table for any of the items listed in the row is higher than the overall Chronbach's alpha, you saw above, than you may want to try removing that item and see how the factor analysis plays out as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpret Output for Inter-Item Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining how nicely each item plays with each other is the realm of inter-item reliability, and this information can be found both in the ```Item statistics``` and the ```Non missing response frequency for each item``` sections.  Under ```Item statistics```, you see first ```raw.r```.  This is the correlation of the item with the scale as a whole.  But there's one big problem with ```raw.r```: it correlates the item with the scale in its entirety, *including* the item itself.  So often correlations are auto-inflated, and you don't really want to use this statistic.  The solution is shown in the ```r.drop``` column.  Here, it has removed the item in question from the scale as a whole, to avoid increasing the correlation value unduly.  This ```r.drop``` column contains what is called the ```corrected item-total correlation``` or sometimes called the ```item-rest correlation```, because it is the correlation of the item with \"the rest\" of the scale. You are looking for all of these ```r.drop``` values to be above .3, and if you find one that isn't, you may want to play around with removing that item, both for reliability and validity analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ```Non missing response frequency``` table, you will find the percentage of people who gave each response option for each item.  The idea here is just to make sure that everyone is not answering all one way for any particular item.  It should be relatively evenly distributed, or at the very least, not clumped up! There's a pretty good chance that something is wrong with your question if absolutely everyone is answering the question the same way!\n",
