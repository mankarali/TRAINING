    "# Software Development Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "The Software Development Lifecycle, or SDLC, has been referred to by many names; Systems Development Lifecycle, Application Development Lifecycle, etc. These terms all ultimately refer to the same essential concept, one that you should become intimately familiar with; the processes by which software systems are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will explore the SDLC to become more familiar with the overall stages of creating software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Exactly is this 'Lifecycle'?\n",
    "\n",
    "For decades, the Software Development Lifecycle has referred to the essential stages of a software product or feature, from concept to delivery.  Although the exact outline of these stages will differ depending on who you are talking to, the gist is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical description of the SDLC may look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Five boxes plotted in a circle, each with an arrow between. From center top moving clockwise, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment.](media/sdlc2.png \"SDLC\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This figure illustrates the typical stages of application development and emphasizes the notion that these stages are cyclic.  The reason for the cyclic nature of this process is that software systems typically require continued development, improvement, and expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 1: Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, stakeholders and domain experts identify what capabilities the system or feature will need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this stage is to define **what** functionality is needed in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This effort typically produces some form of documentation indicating what capabilities are needed, why they are needed, and the requirements for completion of said features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people may be involved in this stage, since gathering the requirements for a feature often reaches well beyond the competencies of the team.  Senior management, subject matter experts, and customers may be consulted when gathering requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the methodology that the team adheres to, this stage will typically be run by a Business Analyst or Product Owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of this stage may be comprehensive requirement specifications, or very lightweight user stories depending on how the team operates.  Regardless, the need to perform some analysis and determine the requirements of the system is essential to SDLC.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 2: Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In the design stage, the team will set out to take the business requirements and transcribe them into both visual and architectural designs for how the system should be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this stage is to define **how** the system should be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage is often a negotiation between Designers, System Architects, and the creators of the business requirements to determine scalable and efficient ways to meet the needs outlined in the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* System Architects or senior technical members will use this stage to evaluate architectural strategies, and available technologies to implement the desired solution. The results of this effort may be a very detailed technical specification, or possibly just a lightweight architectural guideline.  Either way, it's essential that the technical team has some guidance on the tooling and patterns that should be leveraged to create a stable, scalable system within the allotted time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* User Experience (UX) Designers will often leverage this stage to create system mocks, or illustrations showing how the system should look and behave.  They may focus group customers, and produce design artifacts such as style guides and pattern libraries.  These documents will help guide the User Interface (UI) developers towards creating a cohesive look and feel which satisfies customers and stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design stage brings the team one step closer to visualizing how the system will be built, and prepares the team to begin implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 3: Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Implementation stage, the team will build the system while adhering to the design as closely as possible. This is often the stage which is most prone to delays since the implementation of designed features often uncovers challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the majority of the team is focused on the implementation phase, where developers and engineers work to bring the designs to life. Considered to be the most complex stage, which bears the most risk, the Implementation phase is also the longest. To reduce the length of this phase, teams will often staff more personnel in the development tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Implementation stage produces the core functionality of the product or system, which meets the requirements and designs set forth by stakeholders, architects and designers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 4: Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The Testing stage is where Quality Assurance members will ensure that the system is stable and meets specifications. This serves as a detailed check to ensure that the system not only meets the requirements, but is also stable and performs well on intended devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results of the testing phase will inevitably produce bugs and defects that will need to be fixed by the development team.  Most teams are aware that defects are a necessary part of the process, but strive to measure and reduce the occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing stage is also high-risk and prone to delays since it often uncovers significant problems within the system that were unanticipated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing stage will often produce QA-related artifacts such as test plans and testing automation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 5: Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Deployment stage, the system is prepared for launch to the intended users.  Frequently teams will have a dedicated person or group of people assigned to the deployment and maintenance of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of application being built (e.g., web application, mobile app, embedded system, etc.), the deployment process and intended outcome can vary significantly.  Regardless, you can typically anticipate that there is a sequence of moving the codebase through multiple environments for verification and user access.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practice of automating these processes has become increasingly more valuable as companies seek to deploy more rapidly to customers. In many companies, you can now find Development Operations, or DevOps, specialists, tasked with maintaining a Continuous Deployment process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## SDLC and Development Methodologies\n",
    "\n",
    "As you continue through this course, you will explore some methodologies for managing development processes. It's important to note that the SDLC is not a development methodology so much as an observation of the common stages in software development. You will soon see some more opinionated guidelines for managing software teams; however, most methodologies are recommendations for optimizing how to navigate these essential stages.\n",
