    "\n",
    "The first tool is called a *check sheet*. This is a pretty simple tool, and is really nothing more than a tally sheet. This can be an electronic or a paper-and-pencil tool, depending on your needs. Suppose you own an auto parts store. After many months in business, you have started to pay attention to the cost associated with parts returns. Maybe you have also noticed that there are several reasons that parts get returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could put in place a program so that over the next several months, where anytime someone returned a part you would determine what type of part it is. In addition, you could determine the reason for the return. Maybe it was the wrong size or model, maybe the customer didn't know how to use it, or bought too many, or maybe the part you sold was already broken when the customer tried to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an unscientific manner, you have been collecting data to help you better understand how to cut down on returns. Maybe it is a matter of training, or maybe you need to setup your store's display shelves differently. In any event, the check sheet will give you visibility to the groupings that exist, and if they represent a problem to be solved, it will help you know where to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a check sheet, where defect types and the date of the defect are captured in the tally:\n",

    "\n",
    "Another basic quality tool is called the *cause-and-effect diagram*. This is also known as the *fishbone diagram*. It was invented by a man named Kaoru Ishikawa. It is not so much a way of collecting data or displaying data as it is a method for determining possible causes for a problem you're facing. It requires a bit of expertise, or at least pretty thorough knowledge of the process, in order to accurately fill out the diagram. Here is what a typical fishbone diagram template looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A fishbone diagram template.](Media/L03-02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the main horizontal line, some sort of defect or problem is listed. This is the \"effect\" part of the \"cause-and-effect\" diagram. Then, on the angled lines coming into the main horizontal line (both from the top and the bottom), you list all the factors you can think of that would contribute to the effect that is the focus of the fishbone diagram. Each angled line has a specific group of potential \"causes,\" and they are all Ms, to help you easily remember.  The order or placement doesn't matter. The 6 Ms are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Measurement:** Whether your measuring device is calibrated and/or working properly. Is there any human error on your part (or your colleagues' part) that could be causing problems as well? \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Materials:** Consider the different materials that are used in the manufacturing process. You might consider who supplies the materials, and what defects you have historically seen in those materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Man:** Obviously the word \"man\" is used to maintain the alliteration in the fishbone diagram. It could more precisely be stated as \"people\" or \"personnel,\" but hopefully you get the point. When considering people that are associated with the defect, you would have to think about whether different shifts had a different effect on the defect, the training level of the people involved, and whether or not a specific operator was contributing more to the defect than their peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mother Nature:** Consider things like environmental conditions, such as temperature variation, humidity variation, and in some cases cleanliness of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Methods:** The term \"methods\" refers to the processes. For instance, if a manufacturing process relies partially or fully on human interaction as opposed to an automated process, you might take into account things like the technique used to perform the process. For example, the angle at which a metal plate is introduced into a machine might affect the occurrence of the defect. If you have ever watched someone who has a significant skill in making some object by hand, whether it is artwork or a fancy meal, you will notice that they have particular ways to do the little things. These would be considered part of the \"methods\" fishbone.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machines:** In just about any manufacturing process, there is one or maybe several machines used to accomplish the task. The funny thing about machines is they tend to wear down. Parts get old, pieces break, motors wear out, and things generally just begin the process of falling apart from the moment you turn them on. Certainly a contributing factor to a manufacturing defect or process defect is whether or not the machines are being maintained at peak performance levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these categories may seem like they overlap a bit, and they probably do. The point is that with the fishbone diagram, you have an opportunity to brainstorm and determine all of the factors (or at least as many as you can think of) that might contribute to the defect in question.\n",

You have a series of knobs and levers that control the flow rate of the plastic, the temperature of the mold, the cooling time, and other things that are critical to the manufacturing process. If you increase the flow rate of the molten plastic, the plastic block will be slightly larger. So, each time you manufacture a block, you measure the block to see if it is too big or too small. If it is too big, you immediately reduce the flow rate in order to reduce the size. On the other hand, if the block is too small, you immediately increase the flow rate in order to increase the size of the block. Every time a new block is molded, you make an adjustment. This is the method known as continual process adjustment.\n",

    "## Continuous Process Adjustment Doesn't Work!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a man named Walter Shewhart discovered that there are usually many sources of variation in any process. He also discovered that the method of continual process adjustment typically _increases_ the overall variation of the process, rather than decreasing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does this happen? It is called *tampering*, and in layman's terms, it is an over-reaction to the normal variation present in all processes.\n",
    "So ironically, continual process adjustment was thought to make variation smaller, because the operator is \"nipping the variation in the bud,\" so to speak, but the actual result is more variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shewhart to the Rescue!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1920s, there was a man working for Bell Laboratories name Walter Shewhart. He was an engineer that had been looking for ways to improve the reliability of the telephone transmission system. Much of the equipment used in telephone transmission, such as amplifiers and cabling, had to be buried, and the equipment was subject to frequent failures. Shewhart had come to realize the importance of better quality in the manufacturing of the parts being used. When failed amplifiers or cabling had to be removed, he took a close look at them and noticed the quality of the original devices and equipment was usually low. He wanted to figure out how to understand and reduce the variation in their quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shewhart's approach was to let a stable process run, and then see what the normal variation looked like. As a side note, all throughout statistics you are interested in understanding what normal looks like (i.e. the bell curve), so that when abnormal occurs, you will be able to discern it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the same process that Shewhart proposed. He wanted to know what normal variation looked like so when unusual variation occurred, he would know to go and fix it if he could.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was an entirely new approach. The continual process adjustment approach never let anything run by itself long enough to understand what the normal variation in the process actually look like. There is a common phrase that says \"If it ain't broke don't fix it;\" Shewhart took that one step further when he realized that \"if it ain't broke and you try to fix it anyway, you are probably breaking it.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Shewhart's work was very simply stated. His original summary of his observations comprised a document that was about one page in length, and a third of the page had a simple diagram of what today is known as a *Shewhart chart*. This is also known as a *statistical process control chart*. Often, you'll see the phrase \"statistical process control\" abbreviated as SPC. \n",

    "All processes have variation. Usually, variation can be broken down into different sources. For example, the variation in a process might be categorized as a combination of common cause variation and special cause variation. *Common cause variation* is largely due to noise, and is not controllable. It is the natural variation that occurs even when the process is running smoothly. What is meant by the term *noise*? No, you're not suddenly learning about acoustics here, and the next page will not contain a music video - noise is simply another name for outliers. The noise is the mistakes, the data that doesn't really matter but gets collected anyway.  Every process has some noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, *special cause variation* is due to exactly what it says - special causes. It's not normal and it's not expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deming Approach to Process Control\n",
    "\n",
    "W. Edwards Deming was an engineer who in the 1950s became world famous. Deming tried to implement Shewhart's ideas, along with a few of his own, into many industries in America. He was largely unsuccessful. However, at the end of World War II, when much of Japan was simply broken, Deming was called upon to integrate this method into business in Japan. Deming's methods of statistical process control were adopted in many industries in Japan, and his status became that of a \"geeky rock star\" throughout the country. The willingness of the Japanese to adopt his philosophy of controlling quality helped the Japanese to quickly become known for their high-quality products. It wasn't until 20 years of Japanese domination in the reputation for high-quality goods that other countries - including America - decided to adopt the same practices the Japanese had been using.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deming approach to process control has two main ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand what is common cause variation by letting a process run, and observing the resulting variation.\n",
    "* Remove as many of the special causes of variation as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to remove (or at least reduce) the effect of special cause variation, you have to know what it is. To help identify special cause variation, you can go back to the fishbone diagram you learned about earlier. For example, on the fishbone diagram, if excess noise is listed on the horizontal line as the defect, then all of the causes listed on the slanted lines would be considered special causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reduce special cause variation, Deming recommended things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single suppliers for raw materials\n",
    "* Extensive training for employees (especially those doing hands-on, labor intensive work)\n",
    "* As much uniformity in manufacturing as was reasonably possible\n",
    "\n",
    "Having single suppliers often makes production managers nervous. They might worry about a labor strike at the supplier, or an earthquake, and the potential for the supply to be disrupted, thereby shutting down all production at their own manufacturing plant. Deming's philosophy was that the risk of an interruption in supply was far outweighed by a consistent quality in the supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deming often lectured about people who were poor performers. His philosophy was counter-intuitive to many. He believed that most employees are valuable, and want to do a good job. He believed that when an employee under-performed, it was not a function of laziness, it was a function of improper training. He strongly encouraged identifying the best workers, and pairing them up with the least productive workers, in order to train the low performers better.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as uniformity in manufacturing goes, it is common today to see companies follow this approach almost religiously. A large manufacturer might have 6 or 7 manufacturing sites worldwide that are as identical to each other as they can be. A casual observer might go into any one of those sites, and not be able to determine which site they were at, because they are all set up nearly identically - the tool set layout, the work stations, everything. One large semiconductor manufacturer has a reputation for doing \"copy exactly\" in their plants to the point of making sure the waste baskets all look the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at what common cause variation looks like graphically:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The normal distribution depicted graphically](Media/L03-07.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that look familiar to you? It should. This is the normal distribution. Deming repeatedly demonstrated that if a process was just simply left alone to run, whatever was being measured would eventually take on the shape of the normal distribution. Of course, this assumes there are no huge problems (sources of special cause variation) with the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you recall from the lesson on basic statistics the 68-95-99 rule? It said that for a normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Approximately 68% of all values would be within one standard deviation of the mean.\n",
    "* Approximately 95% of all values would be within two standard deviations of the mean.\n",
    "* Approximately 99% of the values would be within three standard deviations of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the fundamental basis for a control chart. If the response variable is normally distributed, then it should almost always be within three standard deviations of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, take the normal distribution and tip it on its side:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The normal distribution tipped on its side](Media/L03-08.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, draw some horizontal lines stretching to the right of the normal distribution. There will be 3 Lines:\n",

    "* A dashed line at the mean\n",
    "* A solid line at three standard deviations below the mean \n",

    "![Three lines, each with the a label. The solid line at the top has the label U C L, for upper control limit. The dashed line in the middle has the label mean. The solid line at the bottom has the label L C L, for lower control limit](Media/L03-10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two solid lines are listed as the *Upper Control Limit* or *UCL*, and the *Lower Control Limit* or *LCL*, respectively. The dashed line between the control limits is the *process mean*.

    "Now, all you need to do is collect data. No matter what the process is, there should be some method determined for randomly selecting and measuring on a continual basis. You might be measuring a single item per lot, or you might be measuring the total sales in a month. Whatever your measuring plan is, the most important part is consistency. \n",
    "\n",
    "As each data point is collected, it is plotted on the control chart. Typically, the older points are to the left, and the newer points are to the right. If your process runs for a long time and you end up collecting hundreds or even thousands of data points, it is customary to only show the most recent points. Usually an active control chart will show anywhere from 20 to 40 points. After that, as new data scroll onto the chart from the right, old data are allowed to fall off of the left side. The 20 to 40 points part is not a hard-and-fast rule, it is a guideline.\n",

    "\n",
    "You should also account for how much data is included in terms of elapsed time. For instance, if your process is collecting several data points every minute, you could end up with thousands of data points in a single day. If your control chart only displays 40 points, and you collect 5 data points per minute, the SPC chart will only show what has been happening over the last 8 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may not be terribly helpful to an engineer that is trying to use the control chart to monitor a process. If the engineer takes a 45 minute lunch break, and then returns to the chart, several full cycles of data will have scrolled on and off again while they were away. You should let common sense help dictate what you want to see on the control chart.\n",

    "# Control Chart Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise of plotting data is great, but the real value in using control charts comes when you apply the control chart rules. There are several control chart rules. All of these rules are based upon probability and the normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the limits of the control chart are at mean plus or minus three standard deviations, and using the 68-95-99 rule, you know that it is very unlikely for a single data point to be outside of the control limits. In fact, the probability of a single data point being outside of the control limits is approximately 0.003, or about 0.3 per cent. That low a probability means something isn't quite right! \n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember, much of data science is the science of recognizing when things are behaving as they normally should, and detecting an instance where something is misbehaving. In the context of a control chart, that misbehavior is indicated by a single point or a series of points that are doing what you would not expect them to be doing under normal circumstances. You will now go over some of the rules that indicate misbehavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are not all of the rules, but these are the most common. Sometimes, some of these rules are slightly different, but similar to what is listed. \n",

The typical reaction should be that it is so unlikely to happen naturally, there must be something wrong with the process. This rule violation is often a sign of a large shift from center, or something has completely broken.\n",

They are not labeled, but are at one and two standard deviations above and below the mean. Again, the violation is indicated by the red circle.

    "\n",
    "Below, you will learn about some of the common SPC pitfalls and the solutions to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem: Calculating Means and Standard Deviations with Wonky Data\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you have learned the theory of SPC based on the assumption that you know what the distribution looks like to begin with. Before you even start, you already know the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. However, this is almost always **not** the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "What usually happens is a new process is initiated, and data are then collected. Quite often, an SPC chart will start plotting data without knowing where the limits should be. When this happens, it is customary that the software calculates both the mean and the standard deviation on the fly while you enter data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if your process is well-behaved, then in the long run this approach would be just fine, because it won't make much difference. What is well-behaved? It means that right from the start, there are no bugs in the process, no optimization needed, and no engineering that has to be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if your process is not well-behaved from the start, then what you are actually doing is taking bad data, calculating the mean, calculating the standard deviation, and then plotting the bad data against a control chart based on bad statistics. This is followed by making decisions about the quality of your process with all of these bad inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you see how this is probably a bad thing? Basically, what is happening is data are being evaluated based on limits constructed from the same data that are being evaluated. It is a kind of circular argument that tends to drive people with common sense sort of crazy. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "So the takeaway is this - when using control charts, you should look for a time when the process is well-behaved. Then, use that time period to establish your baseline by calculating the mean and the standard deviation from those data during the well-behaved period. After that, as new data are generated, plot them on the control chart using the existing limits. This is the only way to determine if the process is stable and in control. You shouldn't be re-calculating new control limits each time a new data point is added to the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem: Creating New SPC Limits with Each Data Point\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, this is exactly how most software packages **don't** create SPC charts. Most software packages will create new limits with each added data point. As stated before, most charts simply require a column of data to use, and they do the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "It is customary for a stable process that the limits should be recalculated every so often, so establish some best practices of when that will be, to keep personal bias out of the evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem: Over-Reaction to SPC Charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Another pitfall that is very common among companies that use SPC to monitor their processes is over-reaction to SPC charts. The less someone understands SPC, the more likely they are to want to \"tamper\" with the system. It is natural; everyone is wired that way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take, for instance, just about any quarterly report for any company whose stock is traded on the open market. Almost every quarterly report will compare the current quarter's numbers to the last quarter's numbers and to the year-to-date quarter. \n",
    "\n",
    "These comparisons will almost always be accompanied by verbiage like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Our second quarter earnings were $6.72B, which is a 3.8% increase over the first quarter, and a 1.1% decrease from the second quarter last year.\" This typically sends analysts into a frenzy trying to explain why things are so much better than last quarter, but a disaster since last year. This is usually followed by a bunch of volatility in the stock price as investors hang all of their investment decisions on the opinions of the analysts. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you imagine how different the stock market would be if, rather than making these sorts of statements, investors were shown a control chart instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose this was in the quarterly report instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Quarterly earnings for company X Y Z. At the top, a solid line labeled seven point zero billion dollars. In the middle, a dashed line labeled six point seven billion dollars. At the bottom, a solid line labeled six point four billion dollars. There are four unlabeled horizontal lines, two above the mean and two below. Data points are scattered. Three data points have identifying information. Q 2 of last year, above the median line at nearly six point eight billion dollars. Q 1 of this year, below the median line at just below six point five billion dollars. Q 2 of this year, above the median line at just above six point seven billion dollars.](Media/L03-23.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, instead of investors going into a complete panic because earnings are down year-over-year, they would simply see that earnings have been relatively flat for the past 5 or 6 years, and that the company is just chugging along. The slight increases or decreases quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year are nothing more than noise, or common cause variation. Nothing has really changed.\n",
