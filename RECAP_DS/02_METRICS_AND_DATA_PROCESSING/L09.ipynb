    "Kanban is another project, or process, management framework which aligns well with the principles of Agile Software Development.  Whereas Scrum has an emphasis on short, measured increments of shippable functionality, Kanban provides a continual stream of production with a focus on reducing waste by only delivering what is desired by the customer.  Kanban is often implemented as a modification of Scrum, adding influence over the workflow, but borrowing concepts like daily standup and User Story structure."

    "# History\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that Scrum was highly influenced by the Lean Manufacturing processes established at Toyota?  Well, Kanban too was a product of Toyota's leadership in efficiency.  The Kanban process preceded Scrum and was established to reduce waste and minimize costly inventory for manufacturing.  The premise was simple; only build what is needed at the time of demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toyota's inspiration came from the retail industry, where direct-to-consumer businesses had already established an impressive system of efficient production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider when you go to a local store to purchase a product.  The store (hopefully) has your desired product in stock.  When you purchase the product, their stock reduces, and they notify the vendor that they need to purchase additional stock to replenish their shelves.  Meanwhile, the vendor (hopefully) has the materials required to create the product.  Once the product is made, they inform their materials vendor that they need additional materials.  This chain continues, with each down-stream *customer* informing the upstream vendor when their services are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time, Toyota was challenged by skyrocketing inventory costs and was forecasting the demand for a vehicle, and producing the components.  Often, they would miscalculate the demand, overproducing expensive parts.  Additionally, having a large number of parts stored in warehouses was incredibly expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, Toyota set out to create a process which models the retail format of *just-in-time* delivery to meet the downstream demand.  They referred to this method as Kanban, which has been widely adopted by software teams today.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Four Pillars of Kanban\n",
    "\n",
    "Kanban is a method for managing the creation of products with an emphasis on regular delivery while not overburdening the development team.  There are four simple principles to Kanban:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualize What You Do Today\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Scrum's notion of transparency, Kanban enforces that the team has readily available reporting to provide visuals that describe the team's progress and bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limit the Work-In-Progress\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of regularly-paced increments, Kanban employs a continuous delivery approach.  When work is completed, and valuable functionality is customer-ready, why wait to deliver it?  Limiting the work in progress helps the team to avoid over-committing on what can be delivered and quickly identifies bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enhance Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate continuous delivery, the team's sole focus is on completing the work in progress, after which they will begin work on the next highest priority item in the backlog.  Flow refers to the pace at which work flows through the team's workflow pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continuous Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "Kanban promotes an emphasis on continuous improvement.  By leveraging the visual nature of a Kanban system, you should strive to improve your efficiencies through a constant re-evaluation of your processes.  This method should be adaptive and closely monitored for opportunities for the team to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kanban vs. Scrum\n",
    "\n",
    "With transparency at the core of the Scrum framework, its crucial that the team builds trust and an ability to share, critique and constructively challenge each other.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In Software Development, Kanban is often adopted as an extension or a modification to Scrum processes.  Kanban has a much less opinionated approach to software project management.  Limiting WIP, continuous delivery and Flow are at the heart of Kanban. However, many other concepts such as the roles and ceremonies are open to the team's discretion.  In this lesson, you will explore the specifics of a Kanban workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kanban Boards\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like a scrum board, Kanban work is visualized on a Kanban board, a tool used to visualize work and optimize the flow of the work among the team. The implementation and tooling of a Kanban board vary from team to team.  As with Scrum, some teams like the tangible sticky notes, while others prefer a more sophisticated software system for tracking their progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function of the Kanban board is to ensure the team's work is visual and available, their workflow is apparent, and all impediments are quickly identified. A basic Kanban Board will typically have three standard swim lanes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table style=\"border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px\">\n",

    "        <td style=\"padding: 10px;\"><strong>Done</strong></td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many teams will expand on these three categories and add additional states. Notably, the *Doing* category is subject to being broken into multiple stages.  As long as the workflow and policies are clearly stated, the team should modify the swim lanes to suit their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the Kanban board serves as the source of truth for the state of the workflow.  It is imperative that team members keep the board current, so the rest of the team members have full and current visibility to the progress of the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Team Kanban Board. A virtual bulletin board with columns headed To do, in progress, code review, and done.

    "## Kanban Cards\n",
    "\n",
    "In manufacturing, Kanban cards were implemented as a visual cue to the upstream vendor, indicating the needs of the downstream customer.  These physical cards would document the specific needs and would be handed to the vendor.  Software has adopted this format to suit your needs, and often Kanban Cards will resemble User Stories, with a familiar format:\n",

    "\n",
    "The reason for using this card format is to ensure visibility to work being done.  Recall that the first of your three Kanban pillars was to *visualize the work you do today*.  Documenting that work and placing it on a visual board helps you to understand:\n",

    "# Kanban Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Kanban is growing in popularity among teams who are motivated to streamline their development and deployment cycle.  A Kanban workflow reduces the pressure on *launch days* by focusing on continuous delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing the Kanban method, software teams strive to achieve the most minimal time-to-value ratio possible.  Time to face it, stakeholders are generally impatient, and many companies have overcome this impatience by employing a Kanban workflow and a continuous deployment system.  At its core, Kanban is incredibly simple; finish a task before moving on, keep your work organized, and deliver functionality as soon as it is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the requirements passed down from stakeholders change frequently.  By *timeboxing* your efforts, you often find yourself telling stakeholders to wait until the next sprint or release cycle.  With Kanban, if the request is urgent enough, it could be the next work-in-progress as soon as you make room in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "By restricting the Work-In-Progress, you immediately identify bottlenecks and skill gaps.  If a team member is available for new work, but the *in progress* lane is already full based on your work-in-progress limits, you will immediately gain insight into how you can optimize.  Perhaps you need more training on a particular skill to move items along the flow, or perhaps there is a broken system which is preventing a card from moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few of the benefits of Kanban:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Because it focuses on continuous improvement, it's likely that teams will continually yield high-quality results.\n",
    "* Due to the focus on continuous improvement, both productivity and efficiency are likely to increase while reducing wasted time and resources.\n",
    "* Goals can be more easily accomplished by Teams due to the visual nature of Kanban boards or cards.\n",
    "* The decrease in waste leads to a higher-quality product or service at a cost-effective price for the consumer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kanban is not as rigid as most of the other methodologies. There are no set times for tasks, and priorities can continuously be reassessed. By delivering small portions of the project to the end user continuously, the project team has many opportunities to fix their mistakes and give the user what they want based on feedback. In this way, the user's needs are met to maximum effect.  Kanban also minimizes wasted work and maximizes the related measures of productivity and efficiency. By wasted work in the context of software development, you mean work that is not needed, incorrect, or not valued.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of story pointing in a _Scrum_ setting is to establish a velocity accurately. In a Kanban workflow, however, there is no concept of a sprint, therefore, no velocity. Kanban teams instead typically measure _Flow_ or the _Flow Rate_ as either the sum of story points in a given time-period or a ticket quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you were to measure productivity as ticket volume. In this case, having equally-sized tickets would be essential to accurate metrics. For this reason, Kanban is often seen as a preferred methodology to teams which are tasked with maintaining an existing system. The measurement here is more historical than predictive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kanban can, at times, be more challenging to predict delivery of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Throttling Work in Progress\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a Sprint structure, Kanban teams rely on limiting work in progress to throttle the flow of cards (stories). This can be a challenging concept to calibrate with a new team and can take time and revision to get to a proper setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WIP limits help to protect the team by establishing manageable rates of throughput for tickets. In Scrum, the sprint planning meeting helps prevent overwhelming the team, as the team has an established velocity and a chance to voice concerns about the sprint backlog. In Kanban, the WIP limit is the only mechanism in place to curb product owner expectations and enable the team to have a healthy balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unified Backlog\n",
    "\n",
    "Sprint backlogs don't exist on a Kanban team since there is no concept of a sprint. Instead, the team can pull at any time, from the top of the product backlog. This requires the Product Owner to be highly involved in the day to day grooming of the product backlog. There is no opportunity for the Product owner to do a _big cleanup_ on the backlog before a sprint planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of continuous flow is that the backlog can be much more flexible. The downside is that it requires much more effort by the product owner to keep it current.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Be Agile First, Be Kanban Second\n",
    "\n",

    "Leveraging what you've learned about the Kanban method, you will need to create a Kanban board to represent a typical workflow for the project described below. Pay particular attention to your swim lanes, your WIP limits, and any specific policies that should be described. Populate a complete product backlog to the best of your knowledge, and ensure that anyone viewing your Kanban board can gain a quick understanding of the status of your project. Meet the below requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Create a Trello Project:** Log into your Trello account and click *Create new Board*.  You can name the project \"ABC Inc. Registration\" or a project title of your choosing.  Select \"none\" for the team and change the board setting from *private* to *public*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Create a Kanban Board:**\n",
    "    -  Ensure your Lists represent appropriate swim lanes for a Kanban project.\n",
    "    -  Pay particular attention to the workflow that is defined by your swim lanes; Kanban offers you more control over the workflow.\n",
    "    -  Create appropriate WIP limits for a team of 6 (4 Developers and 2 Test Engineers).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Create a Product Backlog:** Populate your Product Backlog by adding a minimum of 10 Kanban Cards.  Each Card should represent a user story, and should follow the standard user story format: \"As a ____, I need ____ to ____.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Groom your Backlog:** Reorder the stories by priority with the most urgent stories up top.  Consider the value to the customer, and ensure that the most valuable stories are at the top.\n",

    "\n",
    "* ABC Inc. (your client) is asking you to plan a project to develop a web application which will allow students to register for an upcoming class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* They would like a student to be able to log into a web application and view available courses and then select one in which to register.  Registration will be limited based on classroom capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The administration will need the ability to manage the class schedule, creating, removing, and modifying classes.\n",
