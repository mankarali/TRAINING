So, you need 40 cases.  You are a few cases short of this requirement, clocking in at only *n* = 33, but for learning purposes, you will proceed. However, typically if you did not have a large enough sample size, you would either want to simplify your model (remove either the IV or the time variable), choose a different analysis, or run a procedure called bootstrapping which would re-sample your data until you had a larger *n*. \n",

Next, you are adding in your error term, which is specified in this model by the command ```Error()```. In the error term, you are placing your subject identifier (which matches the pre and the post data together), and you also note that it needs to be done for both time factor groups as well.
