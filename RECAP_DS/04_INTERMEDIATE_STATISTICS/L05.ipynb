    "Even though your data stops in the CSV file after 35 rows (or so it appears), there is a lot of NA data showing up in R if you scroll down a little ways.  It is so very important to always scope your data out when you transfer it, just in case something is not as you expect! Seeing the red flag of having all sorts of missing values, if you examine either the CSV file or the R data frame enough, you will find that the original author of this spreadsheet included some extra statistical tables in the middle.  What a pain! This can be addressed in one of two ways: you can run the ```NaRV.omit()``` function and clean up any missing data, which should remove everything you're not interested in, or you can just subset your data.  In this case, you'll subset the data to only include the rows you want: \n",

    "The other thing that needs to be done with your data is to reshape it, from width-wise to long-wise, so that you can run the ANOVA. The code to reshape only takes the variables that you want to flip and anything you want to hold constant, so you will need to subset your data again to include only the columns you are interested in: \n",

You don't have a time one and a time two measurement. You also want to keep the one change over time variable you are interested at both time points, which is the the resting metabolic rate. After you've created the vector to keep, you can then apply that to your truncated dataset. When you're done, your dataset should look like this: \n",

Basically, you are going to keep the first five columns that don't change by timepoint, and then add to that new columns of `repdat` and `contrasts`.  The `repdat` column will hold the actual data from the baseline section, and the `contrasts` column will hold the information that says it was from the baseline timepoint.\n",

You'll need to test for that unequal relationship between time points and correct for it if sphericity is present. \n",

    "### Homogeneity of Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests you learned for homogeneity of variance for one-way ANOVAs will not work for repeated measures if you need to include any other information.  In this case, you are not just looking for whether the resting metabolic rate increased over time, you are looking to see if it changed over time based on the condition (eating breakfast or skipping breakfast) the patient was placed in.  So, a *Levene's Test* can be used instead to check for homogeneity of variance, using the function from the ```car``` library, ```leveneTest()```.  Here you will specify the variable information you are testing.  Your y variable will go first, separated by a tilde and followed by your x variable and an asterisk, then your time variable. The time variable is ```contrasts```, and remember that it represents time 1 (baseline) or time 2 (follow up). Altogether, you can read this code as a sentence like this: \"Resting metabolic rate by treatment group over time.\" \n",

    "#### Correcting for Violations of Homogeneity of Variance\n",
