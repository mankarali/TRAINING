It allows for the use of multiple dependent variables that are related, as well as multiple independent variables and/or covariates. MANOVAs can be a very powerful tool, and they are especially good screening tests so that you aren't accidentally increasing your changes of Type I error.\n",

    "\n",
    "*MANOVAs* or *multivariate analyses of variance* are in the ANOVA family as well, but now allow multiple dependent variables that are theoretically related.  *Multivariate* - meaning multiple variables! If you are thinking about testing lots of data all at once using the same predictors, or independent variables, it is a good idea to try a MANOVA, because you will decrease the chances of Type I error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other than decreasing error rate, another advantage of using a MANOVA instead of multiple ANOVAs is that it has increased power to detect effects.  You may find that there is no effect of an independent variable on one dependent variable alone, but that when you look at a trend with multiple dependent variables at once, something significant pops up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with ANOVAs, you can have all kinds of variations - one way, two-way, repeated measures, covariates, and contrasts are all fair game with MANOVAs too! \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assumptions for MANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions for MANOVA are relatively similar to those for ANOVAs, but they are ramped up a notch to handle the addition of multiple dependent variables and the increased power.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Sample Size\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multivariate Normality\n",
    "\n",
    "What? You know all about normality, but what is this suspicious multivariate normality?! All it means is that your dependent variables need to be normally distributed when they are lumped all together in one uber-variable that you'll use for your MANOVA.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Absence of Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "*Multicollinearity* is when there is a significant relationship between the dependent variables in your model.  It is to be avoided, since having a lot of overlap between your DVs can again increase your chances of Type I error; finding a significant relationship between your IV and your DV when one really isn't there. Testing for multicollinearity just requires a correlation matrix, although there are specific statistics designed to test for it as well.\n",

    "## Independence\n",

This isn't something typically tested for, but rather assessed by using your noggin as you think about the data you're about to analyze.  If there's a chance that a participant or an object will fit into more than one level of your independent variable, than chances are you have violated the assumption of independence and should not choose to run a MANOVA!\n",
