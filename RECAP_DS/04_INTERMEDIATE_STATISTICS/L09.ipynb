    "You have been working with hypothesis testing for a while, so it's time to review Type I and Type II error rates, and then build upon those concepts. *Type I Error* is when you reject the null hypothesis when you shouldn't have.  This means you reported finding something in your data when there was really nothing.  *Type II Error* is when you accept the null hypothesis when you shouldn't have. This means that you reported finding zilch in your data, but really, there was something interesting of note. \n",

But if you've gotten to the correct answer by rejecting the null correctly, then this is conceptually one minus beta, which is also known as *power*.  Power is important, because it determines whether you have enough data to detect an effect.  Just like your phone won't charge without power, a statistical test won't find anything if it doesn't have enough power.  Said another way, power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false (correct). \n",
