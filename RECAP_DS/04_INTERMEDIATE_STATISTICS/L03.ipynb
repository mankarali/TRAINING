You will use the value “*two.sided*” for a two-tailed test since we want to determine if jellybeans and chocolates are equal or not equal.

As a general rule, anything that has a standardized residual with an absolute value greater than or equal to two is significantly different than what you expected. It is greater than expected if there is a plus sign, and it is less than expected if there is a minus sign. Looking at the results above, you can see the following: \n",

Anything with an absolute value of 2 (can be positive or negative) differs from expected.  However, looking at your post hocs (which have been corrected to account for the possibility of Type I error), you find that none of your standardized residuals are over 2.  This means that this test was not really significant after all.  A good litmus test for this is to look at your row total percentages.  See how sales at the beginning of the month are at 52%, and sales at the beginning of the month are 48%? Although these are technically different, they're pretty darn close, and the test has decided that they are similar enough that it is not significant.\n",

    "Although continuous data is usually easier to work with and you can extract more data from it, there will be times when you come up against a large pile of categorical data (especially if your company collected it themselves!) and you will need some advanced categorical analysis tools in your arsenal! You will use one proportion testing when you are comparing the rate of one item to a gold standard rate.  Two proportion testing will be used to compare rates between items to a gold standard rate.  Goodness of fit Chi-Squares are used to test whether your sample data could feasibly come from the population as a whole, and you can use a McNemar Chi-Square to look at anything that is repeatedly measured that has two categorical variables. \n",
