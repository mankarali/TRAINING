The y axis runs from zero to zero point two in increments of point zero five. The area between six and eleven on the x axis and zero and zero point two on the y axis is shaded in.](Media/L06-01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case you have a uniformly distributed variable with boundaries at 6 and 11. For this variable, any number between and including 6 and 11 is possible. It could be 8.2, or it could be 9.7522583. Every number within the boundaries has the same probability of occurring, which is why it is called \"uniform.\" Any number outside of the boundaries is not possible, or it has 0 probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a discrete uniform random variable might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A graph showing a discrete uniform random variable. The x axis is labeled x axis, number of possible outcomes. The y axis is not labeled. There are eleven equal and shaded vertical bars on the graph.](Media/L06-02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the bars are not labeled in this graph, suppose they are labeled 8 through 18. Since the variable is discrete, the value 9.3 will never happen, so the probability of that outcome is 0. Each number from 8 to 18 is possible and equally as likely as any other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each number 8 to 18 has a probability of about 0.091 of occurring. However, numbers less than 8 or greater than 18 are not possible, so their probability is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example of a discrete uniform variable is the rolling of a single 6-sided die. Each number 1 through 6 has an equal probability of occurring (1/6 or 0.167), and it is impossible to roll a 0 or a 7 or greater with a single die.\n",
    "\n",
    "A spinner with equal sized pie shape pieces is another example of a discrete uniform variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though it is much easier to find examples of discrete uniform variables than to find examples of continuous uniform variables, for the rest of this section you will focus on the properties of the continuous uniform random variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Median:** Because of symmetry, the median is also the midpoint of the min and the max. It is the same as the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation is approximately 30% of the range. Since the range shown above is 2 (remember that range = max - min, so in this case the range is 4-2), the standard deviation is 0.578.\n",

    "# The Student's *t*-Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1900s, a man named William Gosset worked at the Guinness brewery in Dublin. He was exploring how to make determinations about populations with sample sizes that could be quite small.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, one of the things he was looking into was chemical properties in barley when the sample size was as small as 3. Even though he didn't invent the method, he published his findings in *Biometrika*. He used the pseudonym \"student.\"  This is why his work has gone under the name \"Student's *t*.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The *t*-distribution has many nice properties. One of them is that it is a good way to determine probabilities for normally distributed populations where the population standard deviation (sigma) is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine probabilities, one more parameter needs to be explained. There is this thing called *degrees of freedom* for the *t*-distribution. Degrees of freedom will always be associated with the sample size. For the *t*-distribution, if the sample size is *n*, then the degrees of freedom is (*n*-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting thing about the Student's *t*-distribution is that it has a slightly different shape depending on the degrees of freedom. Below is the *t*-distribution for 3 degrees of freedom:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A students t distribution with three degrees of freedom](Media/L06-09.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for 15 degrees of freedom:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A students t distribution with fifteen degrees of freedom](Media/L06-10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly, for 30 degrees of freedom:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A students t distribution with thirty degrees of freedom](Media/L06-11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will note that the *t*-distribution is very similar to the normal distribution. In fact, if you look closely, the normal distribution is overlaid on each of the above graphs of the *t*-distribution, in a light grey color.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the degrees of freedom increases, the *t*-distribution looks more and more like the normal distribution, to the point that at 30 or more degrees of freedom, the *t*-distribution and the normal distribution are indistinguishable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *t*-distribution is useful for determining probabilities when sigma is unknown. Take a look at how the probabilities are calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a situation where you think the population mean is mu, and you take a sample of size *n* from that population, you can then calculate what is often called the *t-score*. Here is the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The equation for calculating the t score. T equals x bar minus mu divided by sample standard deviation divided by square root of n](Media/L06-13.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 variables in this equation. There is `mu`, which is the population mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is *`n`*, which is the size of the sample used. There is *`s`*, which is the sample standard deviation, which can easily be calculated by any number of spreadsheet or programming applications. Then there is *<code><span>x&#773;</span></code>*, pronounced *x*-bar, and it represents the sample mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation looks similar to the *z*-score equation used in the previous lesson, and it is. In general, the main difference is that the *z*-score is used when sigma is known, and the *t*-score is used when sigma is not known.\n"

If, for each experimental unit in the first sample, there is a corresponding experimental unit of the second sample, then the samples are probably paired. Here are some examples of paired data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pre- and post- scores are taken before and after a new training program. The pre- and post- scores for an individual are paired.\n",

Several bikes are equipped with one tire from each brand, and they are given to subjects to ride for 3 months, and then the amount of wear is measured for each tire. Each individual bike will produce two measurements, one for each tire. These two measurements for each bike will be paired.\n",

When comparing two samples, you are trying to see if the amount of variation sample to sample is big enough to call them \"different.\" If there is a pairing that can be identified, the 'pair-to-pair' variation can be removed from the analysis. Anytime you can eliminate one or more sources of variation, your analysis becomes more powerful and more accurate.\n",

How much knowledge the student gained in the course can be found by subtracting the initial, or pre-test score, from the final, or post-test score.\n",

    "This is called a paired design, or dependent samples. It allows you to only have one group of people, rather than multiple, with a pair (or more) of samples drawn from the same person.  In the above example, the two samples drawn are the pre-test and the post-test.  If a student participates in the pre-test, they are automatically selected to participate in the post-test as well because keeping data paired is paramount. \n",

    "Looking at the overall change in scores is really the important thing with paired data. The pre-test knowledge does not matter as much as how much the scores improve over time.  You can conduct a hypothesis test to determine whether the mean of the difference between the pre- and post-test scores differ from each other. \n",

For a dependent *t* test, your degrees of freedom or \"df\" is going to be *N* - 1.  So, your df is 4,176. Armed with your *t* value and your degrees of freedom, you can find out whether this value is significant or not.  You can either pull out a [*t* table](httpss://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/StatPrimer/t-table.pdf), or you can head to [an applet](https://byuimath.com/apps/normprobwitht.html) that does the same thing behind the scenes.\n",

Well, it doesn't have every number listed, and it doesn't got past a thousand.  That's ok - just use the closest number.  In this case, you'll use the row for 1,000.  Then use a two-tailed test at *p* = .05.  Since your alternative hypothesis was just that the mean would not equal zero, this means it is a two-tailed test.  But if you had specified that the mean would be greater or smaller than zero, then you would have a one-tailed test. Assume that significance will be at .05 unless told otherwise; it is typically standard.\n",

    "\n",
    "Effect size is a better indicator than *p* value of how strong the findings of a particular test are, because *p* value depends on sample size via the degrees of freedom, but effect size does not.  This means that if you have a larger sample size, by default it is more likely that something is significant! Therefore, in many cases, people are either adding in an examination of effect size with their examination of *p* values, or may even skip *p* values altogether.  For dependent *t* tests, you can calculate effect size using a measure called Cohen's *d*. Cohen's *d* measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the independent variable. In the example from last page, the independent variable is the time factor (pre or post 9/11), and the dependent variable is the airfare prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the formula for Cohen's *d*:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The equation for Cohens D. D equals D bar divided by S sub D.](Media/105.L4.12.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where <span><code>D&#773;</code></span> is the mean difference you have already calculated and <code>S<sub>D</sub></code> is the standard deviation of the difference scores (also already calculated). This is what the equation looks like when you plug everything in:\n",
    "\n",
    "![D equals twenty one point three five divided by thirty one point six one.](Media/distribution15.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When put into the calculator, that gives you .68. You then need to interpret this value according to convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of Cohen's *d*:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Small:** less than or equal to 0.2\n",
    "* **Medium:** 0.3 - 0.5\n",
    "* **Large:** 0.6 or greater\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with a value of .68, this means you have a *large* effect size, and you can safely say that not only are the changes in air fare fromm pre to post 9/11 significant, but they also have a large effect size and represent a meaningful difference.\n",

Since you don't know anything about the population standard deviation or variance for the two samples, it doesn't seem reasonable to assume they are equal. However, if you assume they are unequal and they are equal, then the two formulas converge to the same value.

    "# The *F*-Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The *F*-distribution is used for some of your most-used statistics - analysis of variance, abbreviated ANOVAs, and regressions, which you will cover in Intermediate Statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *F*-distribution shape depends on the degrees of freedom, just like the *t*-distribution. However, unlike the *t*-distribution, the *F*-distribution actually uses two different degrees of freedom values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to give you an idea, here is what the *F*-distribution looks like when there are four different combinations of degrees of freedom:\n",
    "\n",
    "![An F distribution with four different colored lines that represent four different degrees of freedom](Media/L06-12.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The *`n`* and the *`m`* in the figure correspond to the two values of degrees of freedom. Please note from looking at this graph that a value for *`F`* less than 0 is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"peak\" of the distribution is usually around 1, and the distribution goes on forever to the right side. Much like the normal distribution, the right side the curve never actually touches the horizontal axis, but gets closer as it gets farther out.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've learned about hypothesis testing, this was your first chance to really sink your teeth into an actual analysis! You have completed your very first statistical analysis testing, using three different types of *t*-tests: single sample, dependent, and independent *t*'s.  Now that you have that foundation, in other modules you will be able to compute these analyses and many more quickly and easily using either R or Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You also learned about some additional distributions, to include the uniform, binomial, multinomial, and *F* distributions. \n",

    "For Lesson 7 Hands-On, you have three scenarios. It will be your job to determine which type of t-test to use for each scenario. Then, conduct your chosen test, following all the steps of hypothesis testing, as taught in Lesson 6 and re-iterated on page 5 of the current lesson. This Hands-­On will go towards your grade so be sure you complete all requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps of Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    " * State the null and alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    " * For the Single Sample t-test and Dependent t-test: calculate the test statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value. For Independent t-test: calculate the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Assess the statistical significance by comparing the p-value to the α-level.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Show the appropriate connections between the numerical and graphical summaries that support the hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Draw a correct conclusion for the hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caution!**\n",
    "Do not submit your project until you have completed all requirements, as you will not be able to resubmit.\n",

    "## Requirements\n",
    "For all tests, use a two-tailed test and an α-level cut-off of .05 to indicate significance.\n",
