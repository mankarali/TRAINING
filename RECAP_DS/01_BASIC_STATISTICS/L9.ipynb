    "\n",
    "In DSO104, data wrangling and data visualization will be discussed thoroughly. In this lesson, you will learn the foundations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world, data is at your fingertips and perfectly formatted for analysis. Do you ever watch one of those crime shows where there are one or more computer geniuses retrieving data? You can watch someone do something on TV that only requires a few moments, when in real life, it could take hours at best, and possibly days or weeks at worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you set aside all of the realistic privacy issues, filtering data down is not a trivial exercise. It is true that if the same retrieve-merge-sort-filter routine gets used over and over, it is easily automated. But to do it on demand and on the fly is a large task. The process of retrieving, cleaning, and reformatting data is **VERY** time consuming. It is often more time consuming than the actual analysis that takes place.\n",

You probably have no idea what that stands for. You could guess that it has something to do with a degree, because the data pertain to colleges, but aside from that, you're probably clueless. Furthermore, the values appear to be coded, because a quick scan tells me that they are all 3, 2, or 1. What does that mean? Is it categorical data that is indexed? Is it ordinal data?\n",

Making a few graphs is typically much quicker than trying to look through thousands of rows of a table.\n",

    "\n",
    "* There are at least two negative values. These seem completely out of place given the rest of the data. A quick filter reveals that those 3 rows are for colleges in Palau, Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands. This quick sanity check gives you the opportunity to delete these rows if you want to exclude colleges outside the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are several values that are zeroes. Filtering the data to only show the zeroes reveals they are actually NULLs, and the graphing utility has interpreted them as zeroes for some reason. A quick scan across all the columns of these rows shows that all of the columns are filled with NULLs. These rows may be deleted, depending on the end goal, because they provide no useful new information.\n",

    "In summary, this is just a quick peek at the manipulation necessary to perform any kind of meaningful data analysis. The data preparation step of the data science pipeline is where a lot of the work takes place.\n",

    "This kind of exploration doesn't take a lot of advanced education, but it does take practice. The best data scientists not only have strong analytical skills, but they have a thorough understanding of the data they are using, and strong knowledge about the processes from which they come.\n",

The left side of the pink box is labeled Q1, while the right side of the pink box is labeled Q3. In the middle of the box is a line labeled \"Median.\" The distance from Q1 to Q3 is labeled IQR.  Then a whisker extends to the right of the box, and there is a vertical line labeled Q3 + 1.5*IQR.  There are two green dots to the right of the whisker also.  From this top graphic, four grey lines extend down to a lower graphic, also contained in a box. These lines are located at the left vertical line, left side of the box, right side of the box, and right vertical line.  They drop to a corresponding normal distribution histogram, and you can see that the middle portion around zero sigma is the same pink as the box.  This portion of the histogram is labeled as 50%.  Then there is 24.65% on either side of the pink, shown in blue.  Lastly, the green portions are outside of the blue on either side and are labeled as .35% in the histogram.](Media/L09-39.png)\n",

Suppose that it is a pareto of customer feedback about a local restaurant. If management collected these data to try and create happy customers, they would certainly want to attack the biggest problems first.\n",

For this situation, between high prices and small portions, those two categories (20% of the 10 categories shown) comprise just over 80% of the complaints.  This means that if management wants to put a huge dent in customer complaints, they shouldn't waste their time making sure the food is less salty, for instance, because very few people care about that.\n",

    "One more comment about pareto charts. Sometimes, there are a few categories with large counts, and a whole bunch of categories with very few in them.  It can make it so your pareto chart has dozens of categories on the horizontal axis, and the wording runs over from one category to the next such that you can't read any of them. This results in a cluttered and useless pareto chart, when you don't care at all about the last several categories that are listed.\n",

You can see on the right side where several categories have been combined into one \"other\" category, but now the \"other\" category has more counts than a couple of the categories to the left of it.

    "\n",
    "* **Data format** : Two quantitative variables are needed here. In a table, these data usually are arranged so that each row is a single subject, and there are two data columns, each having a quantitative measure from that subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pros** : Scatterplots are simple to use and easy to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cons** : On the con side, sometimes they are abused because people try to extrapolate the relationship beyond the set of data used to create the scatterplot, and sometimes authors will selectively display data or subsets of data to drive an agenda.\n",

    "![A scatterplot of M P G versus weight. X axis represents weight and runs from one thousand five hundred to five thousand five hundred in increments of five hundred. Y axis represents M P G and runs from ten to fifty in increments of ten. Data points are scattered.](Media/L09-23.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is an example of a great scatterplot. Imagine what the table would look like in this case: it would probably be a couple hundred rows of auto mileage data, where each row represents one car. The weight and MPG of each car is measured, and nearly impossible to interpret by looking at the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a scatterplot is created, in an instant the general relationship is obvious: each dot represents a single car, and heavier cars in general get lower gas mileage.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A scatterplot of S A T scores. X axis shows verbal S A T scores and runs from four hundred eighty to six hundred in increments of twenty. Y axis shows math S A T scores and runs from four hundred eighty to six hundred in increments of twenty. Data points are scattered.](Media/L09-24.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is another good example of a scatterplot. It is not clear if each dot represents a single student, or a class full of students, but it clearly shows at a glance that for the standardized test, higher verbal scores and higher math scores seem to go hand-in-hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A scatterplot matrix titled iris data open parentheses red equals setosa, green equals versicolor, blue equals virginica close parentheses. The matrix made up of a grid of sixteen squares, four rows of four. Row 1, from left to right, sepal dot length, scatterplot, scatterplot, scatterplot. Row 2, from left to right, scatterplot, sepal dot width, scatterplot, scatterplot. Row 3, from left to right, scatterplot, scatterplot, petal dot length, scatterplot. Row 4, scatterplot, scatterplot, scatterplot, petal dot width.](Media/L09-38.png)\n",

    "The scatterplots above are a great representation of data. Instead of just two quantitative variables, there are now four, and the \"scatterplot matrix\" plots each pair of variables. In fact, each pair is plotted twice. For instance, when considering the sepal length to the sepal width, the scatterplot in row 1 column 2 and the scatterplot in row 2 column 1 are reflections of each other.\n",

    "* **Data format** : A line graph uses two quantitative variables, one of which is either a time component (most common) or a distance component (less common).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pros** : Line graphs are a relatively simple graph that can convey a ton of useful information at first glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cons** : If line graphs are used inappropriately, they can be misleading. For example, some people will make a line graph when there is a quantitative variable on the y-axis, and a categorical variable on the x-axis. Unless there is some sort of \"order\" in the categorical variable (which would make it an ordinal variable and not a categorical variable), there is no reason to connect the points and it can be subject to misinterpretation.\n",

Eleven a m, five people. Twelve p m, ten people. One p m, twenty two people. Two p m, fifteen people. Three p m, five people. Four p m, four people. Five p m, four people. Six p m, three people.](Media/L09-27.png)\n",

    "![A line graph titled channel one news viewing figures. The line graph shows multiple trends. The x axis is months and runs from January to December in increments of one month. The Y axis is millions of viewers per day and runs from zero to five in increments of one. To the right is a key that shows the color that each time represents. Blue, one p m. Yellow, six p m.

Your first glance provides good information such as: at 11 PM, viewers peaked in the summer months, and seem to have been taking viewers away from the 9:30 PM broadcast.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense anecdotally; it is expected that families might be busier in the summer evenings and end up catching the later broadcast. Then, when school starts in September, hours go back to where schedules are more conducive to family life.\n",

    "\n",
    "Heat maps and tree maps are similar, in that they both use color and color gradients to display some sort of quantitative variable. Sometimes heat maps are symbolic representations of the data and simply use shapes (generally rectangles) to display different categories, while other times actual geographical maps are used to display things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat maps became widely used in the early 1990s in the financial industry, and then spread out from there to many industries and sciences. Heat maps typically use colors ranging from bright green (for 'cool' regions) to bright red (for 'hot' regions), although it has become more common for heat maps to use the full spectrum of colors, where blue is the 'cool' color and red is the 'hot' color.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data format** : Heat maps usually have at least one quantitative variable that dictates the \"color\" of the region, depending on what the author defines as hot versus cool. If the heat map is rectangular generic shapes used to represent the category, then there is one or more categorical variables displayed (if it is two or more categorical variables, they usually have some sort of hierarchy).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pros** : The heat map shows lots of information at a glance.\n",

When determining what type or types of visualization should be included as you report results, keep the \"principle of parsimony\" in mind - use the simplest approach that gets your point across. Everything else is just clutter.\n",
