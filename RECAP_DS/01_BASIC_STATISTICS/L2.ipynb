If you go back to the example of drawing four Jacks from a standard deck of cards, you'll remember that you had 4/52.  However, this fraction can be reduced - meaning that it is not in its simplest form.  Put another way, you could still divide this further. Four goes into 52 thirteen times, so you can change this fraction to be 1/13 instead.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If your probability is a percentage, it must be between 0% and 100%. To convert a number to a percentage, simply multiply it by 100 and add the percentage (%) sign. To convert from a percentage to a number, divide the percentage by 100. This doesn't require a calculator; just move the decimal point two places to the left.\n"

    "\n",
    "You could list out all the possible outcomes, and then simply count up all the successful outcomes and divide that number by total possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "TTTTT, TTTTH, TTTHT, TTTHH, TTHTT, TTHTH, TTHHT, TTHHH,  \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 10 outcomes with exactly 3 \"heads,\" so the probability of tossing exactly 3 \"heads\" in 5 tries is 10/32, or about 0.313. The total number of outcomes is 32 - count the list above! \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach sounds easy at first glance, but it has some real weaknesses. It can be tedious to make sure that your list of possible outcomes is complete, and unless you are very methodical about it, mistakes are easily made. It can also be tedious to thoroughly count the number of successes. It is easy to miss one or count one extra, throwing your answer off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, if the possible outcomes become large (and they can get large quickly), it becomes impractical to write them all down. For example, there are 512 possible ways to flip 3 \"heads\" in 9 coin tosses. If you wanted to calculate the number of ways to arrange the first 8 letters of the alphabet, there are over 40,000 ways to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the best approach to solving a probability problem is to try and redefine the problem. So time to look at the 3 \"heads\" problem a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is a problem that can be solved mathematically. The previous lesson discussed combinations and this problem is now a question of combinations to determine the number of possible \"*successes*\", or getting 3 \"*heads*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, n is 5, because you are flipping a coin five times, and the x is 3, because you want three heads out of those five times. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you plug it into the combinations equation, you get a total of ten possible ways to get 3 heads out of 5 total coin tosses.  So the number of \"successes,\" or the number of ways that 3 \"heads\" can be flipped, is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Uppercase C open parentheses five comma three close parentheses equals five factorial divided by open parentheses five minus three close parentheses factorial three factorial equals five factorial divided by two factorial three factorial equals five times four times three times two times one divided by open parentheses two times one close parentheses open parentheses three times two times one close parentheses equals one hundred twenty divided by two times six equals one hundred twenty divided by twelve equals ten.](Media/L02-04.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "But you're not done yet! You have essentially found the numerator of your fraction, and you still need to calculate the denominator, or the number of possible outcomes. For each flip of the coin, there are two unique outcomes. For five consecutive flips of the coin, the number of possible outcomes is 2, happening 5 times, or 2 outcomes raised to the power of 5 flips of the coin, yielding 32:\n",

For instance, if you wanted to determine the probability of owning both a puppy and a kitten, you would use an **and** statement. For your reaction to be \"yes, that is true,\" then someone would would have both a kitten and a puppy.  Just owning a puppy or just owning a kitten is not sufficient.\n",

In the case of the graph below, this would be puppy - but since you have anything that is **not** a kitten, it could also include birds, snakes, or horses, for example.

You will get to dependent events later.\n",

    "Using the example above, in which you wanted to draw a three or black card, you will need to first find the probability of drawing a three.  This is 4/52, because you have one 3 for each suit.  Then you will need to find the probability of drawing a black card.  This is 26/52, because there are 13 cards per suit and there are two suits that are colored black (spades and clubs).  Because you have the word **or** in the problem, you know that you should add these together.\n",

    "Moving on, if you didn't know about non-mutually exclusive events, this is probably where you'd stop - but the answer would be wrong! Because you know that there are some black threes, you need to then subtract them, because you have counted them twice above - they were counted once in the count of threes, and once in the count of black cards.  \n",

If you wanted, you could reduce this fraction down by dividing by 2, to give you 14/26, and then reduce again by dividing by 2 to give you 7/13.  You could also convert this to a decimal or a percentage, which would give you .54 or a 54% likelihood that you draw either a black card or a three.  When you apply good old common sense, this seems right - half the suits are black, and so you would expect the number to be over 50%.  \n",

    "Another tricky situation is probability without replacement.  Up to this point, as you have gone through examples, you have always assumed that if you were picking multiple things, they would be put back.  For example, if you are trying to pick two cards, you can either put the first card you drew back into the deck, or leave it out on the table.  If you put it back in the deck, then the probability doesn't change.  But, if you leave it out - *then guess what?* Now you are trying to pick a card from 51 cards in the deck, not 52, and your odds will change. \n",

    "\n",
    "Because this is an **\"and\"** probability problem (ie. drawing one ace **and then** another), you just need to multiply these together. *When you multiply fractions, remember you need to multiply both the top and the bottom*. The probability of drawing two aces in a row is 16 / 2704.  You could reduce this down a little by dividing by 4 (as tere are 4 aces in a deck), to get 4/676.  You could then reduce it down even more by dividing by 4 again, so the fraction becomes 1/169.  You could also convert this to a decimal or a percentage, which would be .005 or .5%. \n",

To test these methods, the researcher will first split the subjects into two groups, next the researcher will apply the traditional method to one group of subjects, then the researchers own  method (hopefully better) will be applied to the other group of subjects, and lastly the researcher will closely review the results to see if the new method applied is more efficient than the old method.  \n",

A random event is an event that has the same chance of happening as all other events. A random sample is when all members of a population have the same chance of being selected.
