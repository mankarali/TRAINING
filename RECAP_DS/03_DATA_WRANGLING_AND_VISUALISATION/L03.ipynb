    "\n",
    "Another large part of data wrangling is *recoding* data.  Recoding is when you change the information in a variable in some way, so that it is represented differently.  For instance, some machine learning algorithms in Python won't allow you to have any string (character) data.  But, you may still want to use this information for the learning algorithm - it just needs to change format.  How do you do that? Recoding! You can put numbers as stand-ins for character values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Take an example variable that has information about dogs' fur colors.  Values in this variable might be brown, cream, and black.  Having those written out as strings just won't fly! But you can put numeric stand-ins for these values.  Usually, you will want to start with 0 or 1, just to make things easier, rather than starting with any random number.  So, make brown be 0, cream be 1, and black be 2.  Now you have recoded them, retaining their meaning, but they are now fit for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recoding to Analyze Data Differently\n",
    "\n",
    "There may also be times when you'd like to examine your data in different ways, but didn't collect data in a specific way.  For instance, you could analyze the feedback data that Woz-U is collecting from everyone at the end of their modules to determine where the largest changes need to be made.  That data automatically comes in tagged by module (i.e. DSO101, DSO102, etc.), but you would like to look at it by the three major programs: Cyber Security, Data Science, and Full Stack Web Development.  So, you could recode the data so that all ten modules for Data Science get tagged with a 1 to stand for Data Science, all ten Cyber Security modules get tagged with a 2 for Data Science, and all ten Full Stack modules get tagged with a 3. Now it is easy to compare the differences between programs, without the information about the modules cluttering things up.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recoding into a New Variable vs. Rewriting your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "When recoding data, you will always have the option of whether to recode into a new variable, thus retaining the original column of data, or whether to replace the data.  Each has a place.  If you are trying to recode for an analysis like machine learning algorithms in Python that will not accept ANY string data, then saving a copy of your dataset and then recoding into the original columns is probably the best way to go.  But if you are running statistics in R, which will only analyze the columns you ask it to, then for safety's sake and ease of use, you will probably want to recode into a new variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming Conventions for Recoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially if you are recoding into a new variable, it is important to have some sort of typical naming convention to indicate a recoded variable that you and your colleagues will always use.  This will help differentiate between the old variable and the new one and will eliminate confusion and mix ups, since some analyses will run data uncoded, but will produce incorrect results! A good standard to use is to place a capital ```R``` at the end of the variable name, standing for recode, so anyone who's looking at your data knows this is recoded. If it is something that went from multiple categories to a \"yes\" or \"no\" or a zero and one placeholder, then you can also place ```YN``` at the end, to ensure there isn't any confusion with other types or recodes.  However, it does not matter what naming convention you use, so long as you are consistent and clear, and you communicate your conventions to your colleagues. \n",

    "When you get to analyses like regression or analyses of covariance, you will find that they require a special kind of recoding called *Dummy Coding* in order to use categorical data.  When you put categorical variables into these types of analyses, they can only have two levels - either something happened / is present or it did not happen / is not present.  Usually when something is present, you will recode it as a 1, and when something is not present, you will recode it as a zero.  That's all well and good, but what happens if you have a categorical variable that has more than two levels? You need to create additional variables, all of which will have two levels only.\n",

Therefore, part of data wrangling and cleaning/screening of your data is to choose how to deal with your missing data, and then execute that approach. The way you deal with missing data is a very important consideration; you have the potential to bias your results if you choose the wrong method for dealing with missing data. Listed below are several approaches to missing data:\n",

    "* Pairwise deletion of missing data\n",
    "* Listwise deletion of missing data\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pairwise Deletion of Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of *pairwise deletion* is for when you only want to remove data from a particular analysis when it is missing the particular variables you are using.  For instance, if you are running an analysis with age, gender, and testing scores, but you have 10 other variables in your dataset, as you do that analysis, you will only remove subjects that have data missing on either age, gender, or testing scores.  If they have other data missing, you don't care, and run your particular analysis anyway.  \n",

    "Especially in R, there are several analyses that are already set up to do pairwise deletion automatically for you, so you don't need to worry about doing anything manually. \n",

    "Using pairwise deletion causes you to have something called a *valid N*.  It means that you no longer have one sample size for an entire project, but rather may have a different *N* for every single analysis you do.  This can be confusing, and depending on your audience, you may need to report upon the valid *N* for all your work. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Listwise Deletion of Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "*Listwise deletion* is when you delete an entire row when it has missing data anywhere in it.  Although this is easy, and gives you one sample size for the entire dataset, it can be problematic, because if your data has a lot of missing values, and you have a lot of columns / variables, you can end up with very few valid rows left.  If you have a dataset with 13 column variables, and 20 rows, and each row is missing a different piece of those 13 column variables, you would end up with only 7 rows left.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You may also end up throwing out good data out with the bad. If you're missing data from a column on species, but have everything you need to conduct the analyses you want to run on age, gender, and testing scores, it would be silly to reduce your sample size! So think carefully about whether listwise deletion is really necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mean Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "Deletion isn't the only way to handle missing data. You can also replace your missing data with other values, which is generically called *imputation*.  One of the things you can replace your missing data with is the mean of that variable.  This is thus called *mean imputation*.  While mean imputation can be useful, it can also be biased, because you end up having regression towards the mean.  Things generally get pulled more towards the average.  This means that you may be reducing your chances of finding something significant, or improving your chances of finding something significant, depending on where your mean was already headed. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hot Deck Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to deal with some of the biases that mean imputation imparts, the process of *hot deck imputation* was developed.  In hot deck imputation, you are still filling in data for missing values, but you are filling them in with a little more finesse.  Hot deck imputation tries to fill in values conditionally, based upon important variables.  So, if you see that most women in their 40s have a certain average body temperature, for instance, you would use that average to fill in missing data about body temperature for a women who is 43, rather than using the generic average. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hot deck imputation is still just making data up, but it is a slightly more educated guess than mean imputation.  It can still bias your data, and it can still be incorrect."
