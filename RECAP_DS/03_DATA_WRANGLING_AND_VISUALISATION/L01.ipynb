One of the best-kept secrets in data science is that you will spend most of your time wrangling the data into the right format, not actually running analyses.  Prior to this, data has mostly been clean and ready for your immediate usage, so you'll now start to get a feel for the work that goes into preparing a dataset for analysis.  You'll start with the basics of data manipulation - learning to play around with columns and rows.\n",

Although it’s always nice to be able to rename columns to something that is meaningful for you to work with, it becomes especially important if the source of your data allows spaces in the header row.  For instance, in MS Excel, you are allowed to have headers at the top of your data with spaces in them.  However, R and Python tend to throw up errors when you try to call any columns that have spaces embedded, and while R will default to removing spaces and instead placing a period as a separator in most cases, Python will not.

Good column names can make the data analysis process go much easier, since it is easy to tell what data is contained with them and it does not take long to reference the columns.  Poor column name choices can increase the complexity of your data analysis by confusing yourself and others, both with a poor name/data fit and with an increased chance of making typos.  A good column name will be short, succinct, and easily understood by someone who does not work with the data regularly.  It will also be easily read – so make sure that column names with more than one word are either in *camel case* (EveryFirstLetterCapitalized), or have some other delineation like periods (periods.between.words) or underscores (underscore_between_words).  Using some typical naming conventions will save you many headaches later on.\n",

This could be a character like a ```/``` or ```,```, or it could be blank in the quotes, indicating a space.
