    "\n",
    "### Time Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you work in a school district, and are tracking student scores on a standardized exam. You have a student's scores for each year, starting from 1<sup>st</sup> grade through 9<sup>th</sup> grade. Maybe your data table looks like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "Note that there is exactly one data point for each value on the horizontal axis, and there is a 'continuation' of sorts, in that as you move from left to right, time is marching forward at a constant pace. This is the ideal setting for a trend chart, and it makes sense to connect the points with a dot-to-dot line:\n",

    "\n",
    "* It draws your eye naturally to the direction and movement of the trend. \n",
    "* It allows you to create a trend graph without showing the individual data points at all. This can be especially helpful if there is a ton of data on the trend graph. It is easy to get the picture all gummed up with individual data points, to the extent where you lose sight of the bigger picture. \n",

    "Okay, you will now look at an example where the horizontal axis is not a time stamp. Suppose you are an agricultural scientist, and you are working on a new way to compost organic waste.\n",

    "You have created a large compost pile, and introduced an enzyme that should speed up the process of breaking down the organic waste to mulch.Temperature is a big factor in decomposition, and you have devised a probe that has several high tech thermometers at evenly spaced intervals on the probe.

    "* If 'time' is your horizontal axis variable, then formatting is important. Most software recognizes time stamps and adjusts the spacing automatically. But if your time stamp is something like year and workweek without any spaces, slash, or hyphen, then you would have the end of 2016 look like this: 201649, 201650, 201651, 201652. Then, the first weeks of 2017 would be 201701, 201702, 201703, etc. Your graph would then look something like this:\n",
