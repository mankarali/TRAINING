The red designates the men who enter Russia, the black those who leave it. — The information which has served to draw up the map has been extracted from the works of M.M. Thiers, de Ségur, de Fezensac, de Chambray and the unpublished diary of Jacob, the pharmacist of the Army since October 28th._\n",

For this reason, dashboards often follow a red/amber/green color scheme to indicate status, with red being \"in trouble\" amber being \"potentially problematic\" and green being \"hunky dory.\" Managers like dashboards, because they can get a general feel of what is going on with the business at a glance.\n",

But when researchers scrutinized the data a bit more, they found that there was actually some bias in favor of women! Something called *Simpson's paradox* was at play here. Simpson's Paradox occurs when the observed phenomena is different from the explained phenomena after a lurking explanatory variable is taken into account.\n",

    "In the case of Cal-Berkeley, the overall fact was true: more men (as a percentage of applicants) were accepted to grad school than women. In this case, the lurking variable is the programs to which these men and women applied. It turns out that more men applied to graduate programs in science, whereas more women applied to graduate programs in the humanities. The sciences require special technical skills, but they accepted a large percentage of applicants. On the other hand, the humanities only required a standard undergrad curriculum, but they also had fewer slots. When the department to which they applied was accounted for, department by department the women's acceptance rates are actually higher overall than the men's acceptance rates. The difference was small, but real.\n",

This page is meant to give you an idea of what is possible in MS Excel, and you can choose to watch additional material on the details if you'd like.\n",

    "![Snapshot of a sheet displaying a table of data and a corresponding bar chart. The table is represented in two columns and nine-row entries. The column headings are labeled date and sales. The bar chart represents the date on the x-axis and sales on the y-axis. The bar chart has a caption on top that reads, sales for the last six months. The bar for Feb 2014 crosses 1200 on the y-axis.](Media/L09-01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a clever use of inputs from the user. This chart is dynamic in that it allows a user to change the entry in cell N1, and determine how many months worth of data they want to include in the graph. Changing the entry in cell N1 to 3 (for example) will modify the amount of the table in columns A and B that are included in the graph. It also modifies a cell (not shown, off to the right of the shown portion) from which the graph title is taken. If cell N1 is changed to 3, then the graph label will read ```Sales for the last **3** Months```.\n",

The column headings are labeled year, shirts, pants, and shoes. The graph represents the year on the x-axis and sales on the y-axis. The bar chart has a caption on top that reads, shoes.](Media/L09-02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this graph, a table to the left shows sales figures for Shirts, Pants, and Shoes for an eleven-year period from 2003 to 2013. The graph is set up to show one article of clothing at a time, selected using the radio buttons at the bottom of the graph. Again, this is a clever trick where the creator of the graph has set up a dummy table which is out of view. When the user selects one of the radio buttons, the dummy table is modified so that the two 'not selected' columns from the original data table are filled with N/A's. This modifies the graph so that only the selected curve is shown.\n",

If you have a graph like this, and took the mouse to pull down on the scroll bar, one by one new data points would appear on the graph. This is another clever little trick that uses the scroll bar to determine how many rows of the 'Sales' column appear on the table at the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "One note on this graph - Is it practical? Can you think of a situation where you would only want to show a portion of the available data starting from the left? Perhaps to build drama as you scrolled down slowly, and added points to the graph, but this dynamic chart may be less useful than the others. \n",
