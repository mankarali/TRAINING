    "# Variable Types and Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several major factors that go into choosing what type of analysis you will run, but the most important component of all is what data and variables you have. Reviewing variable types and levels as they pertain to choosing statistical analyses is critical! \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Two major variable types will be discussed throughout this lesson.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "The first is *continuous*.  A continuous variable is one that is numeric, and where a bigger number actually means that you have more of something.  For instance, height is continuous - the bigger the number of feet tall you are, the taller you are.  Don't be fooled - sometimes data can be in numbers, but not actually be continuous.  This happens a lot after recoding.  What if you recode hair color from black, brown, and blonde into 0, 1, and 2? This is numeric, but does the number actually mean anything? Are blondes, given a 2, any better or larger than those with black hair, given a 0? No.  So make sure that when you are assessing your variables, you take into account not only whether it is numeric or not, but if the numbers have meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The second variable type is *categorical*.  A categorical variable is a category - it's right there in its name.  You have distinct things that are grouped into like sections.  Often a categorical variable is a string variable, meaning that it is in letters.  Something like writing out the names of each hair color.  But sometimes, numbers can be substituted for the groups to make analysis easier.  You still have categories underlying it though - you've just substituted a number for the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "A special kind of categorical variable is one that is *dichotomous* or *binary*.  All those terms mean is that you have only two groups, instead of more. So something like \"pass / fail\" categories or \"dead / alive\" categories etc. are great examples of dichotomous or binary categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have categorical variables, those variables can have *levels*.  The number of levels is the number of groups that variable has.  For instance, in the hair color situation, where the options are black, brown, or blonde, hair color is one variable, but it has three levels, or three choices, of hair color.  It's all one variable - hair color - but has multiple responses that someone could have, which is the levels.  Certain analyses require variables to have only two levels, so its important to identify the number of variable levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Independent vs. Dependent Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing you'll need to take note of when choosing analyses is determining your *independent* and your *dependent* variables.  The independent variable, also known as the *predictor* variable, and abbreviated *IV*, is the variable or variables that influence your dependent variable.  They are causing some sort of effect.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dependent variable, also known as the *outcome* variable, or abbreviated *DV* is what you are influencing.  It's what you're predicting.  It is the effect that is being caused by your independent variable.  The dependent variable **depends** on the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In choosing an analysis, after you know the purpose of the analysis, typically you'll need to choose the data types of your IVs and DVs. Being able to distinguish between continuous and categorical variables, understand the levels of the variables, and identify your independent and dependent variables, are essential skills for data scientists.\n",

    "# Making Associations between your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, there is a branch of statistics purely for making associations between your data, or understanding how data fits together.  It has nothing to do with hypothesis testing or drawing conclusions.  When you are trying to navigate these statistics, first ask yourself if you are trying to validate a scale (survey).  If you are **trying to validate a scale**, then determine whether the scale has been validated before.  If it has been **previously validated**, then you will need to run **Confirmatory Factor Analysis**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the scale has not been validated before, then you then want to determine if you want to find the minimum necessary number of factors.  If you do want the **minimum necessary factors**, try **Exploratory Factor Analysis using Principal Axis Factoring**.  If you **don't require the minimum factors**, then you can still run **Exploratory Factor Analysis**, but it needs to be **Principal Components Analysis** instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you're not trying to validate a scale? What then? Well, then you need to determine if you are trying to create a theory.  If you are **trying to create a theory**, then you will undertake **structural equation modeling**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not trying to create a theory, then you need to determine how many variables you have. If you have **two variables** (independent or dependent, it doesn't matter), then you need to note the type of data you have.  If it is **categorical**, then you will run a **Spearman Rank Correlation**.  If you instead have **continuous** data, then you will need to run a **Pearson Correlation**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when you have more than two variables? In that case, you will need to ask yourself if you are **trying to predict group membership**.  If **yes**, then make use of **Discriminant Function Analysis**.  If **no**, then try using **Cluster Analysis** instead. This is all documented in the flow chart below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A box labeled purpose: make associations, are you trying to validate a scale? Is connected to two boxes labeled yes and no. The yes box is also labeled a question that reads, has the scale been validated before? And the no box is also labeled a question that reads, are you trying to create a theory? The Yes box is again connected to a box labeled structural equation modeling and the no box is connected to again a no box labeled with a question that reads, how many variable do you have? It is connected to two boxes labeled two, what data types do you have? and more than two, are you trying to predict group membership?. The box labeled two is connected to categorical and continuous which are again connected to two boxes labeled spearman rank correlation and Pearson correlation. The box labeled more than two is connected to two boxes labeled yes and no and that are connected to two boxes labeled discriminant function analysis and cluster analysis. The first yes box connected to another two boxes labeled yes and no, do you want the minimum number of factors? and it is connected to yes and no. The yes is again connected to a box labeled exploratory factor analysis: principal axis factoring and the no box is again connected to a box labeled exploratory factor analysis: principal components analysis.](Media/analyses5.png)\n",
